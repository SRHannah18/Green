<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Hey, Cap.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Hey. How's it going?
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Going well. How are you doing?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Pretty good.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Yeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn't have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here's where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.
<br><br>
At BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn't have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn't even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What's your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn't be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
And then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I'd been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it's clear, and then we'll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I'd say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.
<br><br>
It came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn't doing it for everybody. It wasn't clear enough. It wasn't actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it's largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It's super good." I'm sure in a year we'll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It's so much better than anything I could have done on my own.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
That's where we're at right now.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What kind of things weren't working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Some examples. I'll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn't really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It's not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.
<br><br>
I think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they're doing a good job, and I think it's hard to know from a Doc like that that you're doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here's the mid level role and here's the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Cool. It's interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they're doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they're doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they're doing a bad job?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Yeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we're like, "Hey, you're not living up to this part of the role. We're going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It's really helpful. Again, I've been in situations where I've felt like somebody wasn't doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn't able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it's not the same as being able to point to something that we've all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.
<br><br>
I didn't have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you're not making it up. You're not changing the bar. You're not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you're both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn't been happening. Let's talk about that." As opposed to, "You're not writing code," and the designer's like, "Well, I didn't know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It's actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it's not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed's design roles, and I know you've written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Making these public, there's probably a 2-part answer to why we think that's important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it's a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that's really important. I think it's really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it's a good thing. It's management's version of open source.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
There was no such thing. That's the second reason. That's why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it's taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it's probably one of the more ... It's not the most important thing, but it's really important. If you have bad management or people who don't know how to do it or whatever and they're not supportive, you're going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.
<br><br>
I know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that's happened, and that's awesome. That's great. I'm hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that's a really great thing to have in the world. I don't understand why more people don't share those. There's no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We're not changing the world here.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I'm going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we'll see, but we'll go with it. You said it's like management's version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they've forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that's a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
We've talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven't gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we've been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we're just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don't want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.
<br><br>
There are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren't a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You don't state a community manager just for that particular thing.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I think so. Those aren't the only Docs we've put out in the public either. We're going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we're able to have now, but it's definitely come up.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what's IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
The IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you're not managing people directly. That's one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What's interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There's no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I think that would make sense.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
But I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that's the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person's not a good manager and he's miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that's a huge bummer, so what we've done is we parallelized the tracks, so that's why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Absolutely.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Then M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we'd obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What's funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they're managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people's design work and stuff and impact that. I think it's really cool.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Totally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
It should be in the same Doc, or if it's not, that's my bad and we need to add it in.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. What's the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
The IC's, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there's a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we're doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don't know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC's, I've found, is with a designer, it's really clear what's going on almost all the time.
<br><br>
You can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person's career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it's a black box. I don't know what's happening in someone's one on one. I'm not in the meeting with their other director level people that they're in together. I'm not there so I don't actually know what's happening. You know what I mean?
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
They walk out of a one on one and I'm not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can't actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
New managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it's hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you're still holding on, you're really in the work all the time, and you're pissing off the designers. It's totally what's happening, so it's really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I'm trying to buffer that so the designers don't all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That's a really tricky thing to do.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Sure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC's or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Successful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they'll have any conversation, they don't care. You know what I mean?
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
They'll just go after it. They're very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she'll just try anything. If someone has an idea that's not hers, she'll just do it. Even if she thinks it's totally wrong. She'll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn't work." Just zero ego. It's super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don't know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
And was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren't a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that's insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Managers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What do you mean by that?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I always get really nervous when someone's concealing what they're doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I'm going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it's not going to be perfect. There's going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it's breaking or something's not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I'll never know and I'll just think everything's fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.
<br><br>
I know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I'm sure it's going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven't yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I see.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Does that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don't have any idea. They're not even watching and they're not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you're ... Design's the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I'd come with design work and I'd be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something's wrong with it. I don't know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something's not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn't have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn't have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what's going on with it, that's a good thing.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Yeah, totally. I think people wish they didn't have it, but I actually really trust people that do.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I love that. I don't think I've ever heard anybody say that. It's really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let's dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it's your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you're doing there and what you're going to be doing there.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
My official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I've been able to do things I don't think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I'm responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I'm not sure they're all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn't exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where's the logo?"
<br><br>
No one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
And that's great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn't able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don't have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn't know what that meant and now I totally know.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What does it mean?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
A year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I'm going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There's a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We're doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I've realized, at this point, that I've taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we're most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team's self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he's built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we're talking to them so much, all the time, and so I'm going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we're moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Which feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I'm really excited for them because it's a really great change. It'll actually, I think, empower them even more than they've been. It'll be good. At the same time, like I said, I'm managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they're starting to really lead the team as a whole.
<br><br>

It used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we're working on, and that's not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That's crazy, so these three people together know everything because they're working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I'm starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?
<br><br>

If I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that's, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Just heckle and throw eggs and stuff.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
It was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I'm in this weird moment where I don't really know what's next for me internally, and it's something I'm talking about with my manager. I've been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Interesting.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Stay turned. I'm sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Do you fear that at all? Do you think there's one day you're going to be like, "There's nothing left for me to do."
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I don't fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name's Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She's very literal. She's a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can't do that, right?"
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I was like, "Yes, I know. I'm just kidding." I don't know. I'm not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You're really great at making yourself not indispensable. You're really good at planting yourself obsolete."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Interesting.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
She was saying that, it's like a compliment. It's a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It's like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I'm setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn't matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It's not my team. It's BuzzFeed's team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I'm not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don't talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don't worry too much about it as long as I feel like I'm doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I'm responsible for.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so awesome. It's very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You're taking the opposite approach.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn't have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn't have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who's really good at that stuff? It's Cap." She pinged me one night and she's like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I've taken that on, and I've been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it's opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.
<br><br>

It doesn't have to be even design related. I'm excited to figure out what other stuff I'm able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That's why I'm probably talking about it so much right now, where I'm like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He's a great design manager, but I don't feel like-" ... I don't think that's right. I think it's just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Interesting.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I'm not sure what's next, but I don't really fear it too much.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you've got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
It's vital. I think like measuring, people don't put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It's funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn't matter if it's on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I'll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn't really pay attention to the language, it wouldn't be effective. It probably wouldn't be clear.
<br><br>

I think there's a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they're doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that's not going to take hold as much as if you have something you're referring back to constantly.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
No.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Refer to these documents a lot?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
We refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle's Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we're using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that's the person I don't want to be so bad.

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Back in 2006, I recall that I said-

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I trademark it myself. Terrible.

Last topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here's the way it is," and that's not actually accurate, but it's the way that you want it to be, so you're setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it's really hard to hire good people, but also, if you're the one trying to be hired, it's really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I think hiring great people, I think people think it's hard. I don't find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It's funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It's just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don't know. I do not find that difficult. I think there's a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn't use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they'd send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.
<br><br>

They weren't in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there's no way it's not the recruiter's fault. It's a sniff test for, as a designer, I'm like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It's these weird things that people won't think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who's in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn't really know about product design at Etsy and didn't know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that's why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.
<br><br>

I think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I'm getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It's weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that's why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that's actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you'll find people who want to work that way.
<br><br>

If you're trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn't know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That's been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.
<br><br>

I got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don't know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that's okay. I don't think I've ever hired anybody out of that. I don't think anybody's ever looked for a job that way so far. I don't know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don't post job listings for design, so no one would even know we're hiring, and so we reach out super ... It's all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Why don't you post job postings?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
We did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you're talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
It's like just doing the math about what's the most effective for us. I don't know if that's right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
There's this interesting thing that I've noticed with it, and I think you'd probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they're not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we're having problems with diversity. We're working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You're like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it's up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that's not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.
<br><br>

I think that's really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don't know. It's not something I think we're super conscious of all the time, but it's definitely there in the background. There's a background process ring where you're like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that's probably a good thing in the end.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don't mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I don't if I'd say everything to get email about.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Kind of an oxymoron.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
I don't know. Every once in a while I'll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It's funny. I don't write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I'm writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It's my thought process that I'm going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it's really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.
<br><br>

If that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don't know. I get random emails from people. They're like, "I'm coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It's cool to me how their designers are like ... I've met designers that are all over the career pathway where they're just starting out. I met someone the other day who's transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that's been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn't normally meet.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome. We're can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
My website has my email address on it so it's just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Very cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.
</dd>

<dt>Cap </dt><dd>
Sure. Thanks for having me.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
My pleasure. Take it easy.

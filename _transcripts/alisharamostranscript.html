<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>So, I don't think I've actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can't find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn't really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs) Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it's being sold in that way, right? Like, you're given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.
</dd>

</div>





<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>You think that's not, that's not true? You, that doesn't happen?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it's worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren't quite honest about is, you know, they don't really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it's really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don't think it's, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.
<br><br>
Um, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they're packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It's a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn't start working in tech or I didn't start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn't my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I've always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn't have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that's a lot to ask, so.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah. Totally
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>So, so.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>
So, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They're providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don't have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there's a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that's a problem.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>But maybe don't know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>What can we all do?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that's true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It's more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>What do you mean by that?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn't be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it's, it's about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn't grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.
<br><br>
Um, I don't think that's the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they're, they're not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don't know that it's an option, so I think that's really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>
And all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I've learned over the past few years that I've been working now, um, it's more than the skills that you have. It's more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It's about trusting you team. It's about garnering trust within your team. Um, it's so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Uh, I don't know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don't know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it's h-, it's hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Or other engineers there?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I'm a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I've been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don't actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we've been talking about it, but it's, it hasn't really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it's, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don't think I've ever ... I hope she doesn't listen to this podcast. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>But I don't think I've ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I've really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>What's the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What's the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you're assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person's gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven't defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it's, it's literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I'm facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it's never, like, I feel like it's really awkward to (laughs)-
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>I have not. I've never, yeah, I just can't do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>
No, I haven't. I've, I've participated. I've signed up for mentorship programs where it's usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don't know. It, it hasn't really worked out well yet.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah, gotcha.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Well, that's what this podcast is here for.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah, exactly.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don't think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it's just things like that. I don't think I have any hard skills, but I think they're still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>
I would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>What does, what does that mean?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>The extra hand-</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Sure.</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don't think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they're kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah, cool.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Um, yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Do, do you think that's too much pressure for an intern?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>That's a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that's great. I definitely wouldn't expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Ex, exactly.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>It's like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>You know, still attainable.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>There's one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I'm very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that's an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>It's not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>
You know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I'm like, "I'm really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>And I feel like that's a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn't play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don't think I've ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that's happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it's, it sounds like if you don't know my back story, it's just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn't grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don't speak English very well.
<br><br>
You know, it wasn't, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that's like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there's a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn't know that and they didn't know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Including where I'm at now, so yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's amazing.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>I-I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah (laughs).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>About being, about being mixed race.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Eww, that's a (laughs)-, that's a great (laughs).
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>No, that's a great question. Um, I think that, that's a wonderful question. I think that it's hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don't see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it's like they're a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”
<br>br>
No, that's a great question. Um, I think that, that's a wonderful question. I think that it's hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don't see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it's like they're a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>In learning or teaching?
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don't know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they're always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It's called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Okay. Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>
And I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>(laughs) Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it's career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it's, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's super interesting. Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I'm like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that'll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that's just fascinating.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>It really is. That's crazy.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it's like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's interesting. Well, I'll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I'm, I'm like you. Help me out."
</dd>

<dt>Alisha </dt>
<dd>(laughs)
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?

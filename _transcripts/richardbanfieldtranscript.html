Hey Richard.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Hi.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You guys just did an amazing thing today, you open sourced your apprenticeship, right?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
We did, we took the leap and we done the thing that we should have done a long time ago, and that's made it public.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That is so awesome, can you just talk about everything you can about that. What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Sure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We've done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.
<br><br>

Making it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we've been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we've gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we've got better ideas." Or, "We've got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
We had been doing internships and we'd been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it's a fairly new idea. When I got back, I'd asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let's just try it, let's just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool. Now you had mentioned there's a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you'd kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let's go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don't know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What's the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Sure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it's something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what's coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let's say you're a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that's like, or in some cases if you're in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you're taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you're creating.
<br><br>

The reason why it's different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let's have this person here for a short amount of time while they're doing this thing." It's almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you're putting you're time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
The selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we've been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they're trying to get out of the program. We'll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we'll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they're going to work on things that we challenge them with. We're going to provide them with a product, we're going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.
<br><br>

We're going to assess them across different criteria. We're going to look at their actual work, so if they're designers we're going to look at their design skills. If they're developers we're going to look at that. If they're a combination we're going to look at both. What we're also secretly doing is we're seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it's like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We're looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we'll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.
<br><br>

We also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we've got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they'll go through that, the 15 week program.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. It sounds like you're looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you're looking for cues that they're going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
They're the same. We're looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we're definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We're looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can't necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture's different that, but that's something that we have no control over.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
How many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don't?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
In general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we're in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We're actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we're starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We're like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have let all of them go and find other jobs." We're pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They're part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that's one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
In the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn't it work for apprenticeships too.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Exactly. They've gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who's who, it's amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that's a pretty strong group of people
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah, that's amazing. What kind of person doesn't make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you're like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
In our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who's designing a digital product. We're looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they're unable to communicate it effectively, or they're unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don't work well in teams and they don't collaborate well. Those are the things that we've identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
I don't think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we've grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they've gone on to get into serious relationships, they're married, they've got kids, their lives are changing.
<br><br>

Just by the nature of the fact that they're aging, they're also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there's always good talent that's coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn't just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We're just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you're growing then you're probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Do you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
No, I think initially we probably weren't doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren't really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we're now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you're not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you're still about to carry those skills with you. That's been one big change.
<br><br>

The other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you're in the crucible, you're with the client, you're dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there's no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we're paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they're working on client project then they're billable, and if they're billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it's certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
We're 100% transparent about it, and because we're transitioning them into projects where there's already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We're not saying, "Hey, I know you've been working with this person who's senior and skilled, and we're replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We're saying, "We're going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they're doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we're amplifying the work we're also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You're speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what's your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
I've some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they're doing. Then, I'm also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.
<br><br>

This is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you're the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it's amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they'll decide what they want to do, they'll go and study it, and then from then on it's just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.
<br><br>

What we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there's a very good chance that it'll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it's very emotional, but once you've got through that stage it's so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don't have to go to job boards to find a job. I don't have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I'm definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I'm going to go an reach out to them. I'm going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we're giving them a skill that they'll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Oh man, I'm getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
I think I said at the beginning that we're designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we're working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don't really care so much about which industries we're working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they're trying to solve, or problem they're trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we're not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice, and you're in the Boston area right?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Yeah, we're about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We're just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
How much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it's just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn't matter what it is, I'm going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
I'm not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we've had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don't think location matters as much. I think people, because that's a paid apprenticeship, they're willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I'd say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.
<br><br>

That's hard, it's really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it's incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it's also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That's really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we're pursuing that, and hopefully one day we'll even be successful at actually doing that.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Amazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
I love conversation that's challenging, and I love these topics that we've been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it's value pricing, or the education stuff that we've just been mentioning, whether it's culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that's the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I'm going to respond to.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Very cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
On Twitter I'm RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there's two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I'm afrotrash.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Richard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
You're welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
All right, talk to you soon.
</dd>

<dt>Richard </dt><dd>
Chow.

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>It means, I and my team, we're trying to help product designers do better work. We're doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We're doing interviews with experts in the field, and we're trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that's a really important topic, because we're seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We're also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We're not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.
<br><br>
We're writing about them, and that's going to turn into some advice that we're going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design's about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there's a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don't directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It's worth noting that I've been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I've been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I'm an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it's also, we're seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They've got the whole legal team in there, or they've got like engineering inside of InVision. What's interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it's becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what's good and what's bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that's connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they're doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They've got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they're doing. They're having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you've been in the design world for a while and you've interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn't always go so well, right?
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Right. Right.</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can't do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That's not what's happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they've got to have legal oversight, but it's a dialogue, and it's early, and it's often, and that's the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it's transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don't think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Yeah, it's a new position. It's Clark Valberg, who's the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark's vision, and it's one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I'm really passionate about.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It's really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we're not ... Historically, we haven't done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there's a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You've got Codeacademy, and you've got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they've got a bachelor's and they just need to supplement that, but ...
<br><br>
My experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I'd have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I've got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.
<br><br>
Doing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it's all this internal dialogue, but when it's an external dialogue and you're teaching twenty or thirty people who aren't clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that's one of the key things for ... Whether you're new to the industry or you're a veteran, is writing, even if you're not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It's clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you've got to share it. When you have to share it, that's when you've truly learned it.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>That's awesome. Let's go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That's certainly a model that, you know, you're not the first one to recommend that, or that there's a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I've taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that's a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you're working on client work, or you're trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It's not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they've got something at stake, "I'm trying to figure this out. This is real," and they'll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I'm working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.
<br><br>
They were already trying to serve themselves, it's not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I'll try to soak them up." They're actively shaping their education on their own.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you've been educator, like, formally educator, and then you've been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>I think there are some similarities. There's a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that's going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you're leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That's a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How's life? What's going on? What's happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person's under a lot of stress right now, and that's probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work's not as good as it could be. They're just not as focused on their work right now."
<br><br>
I think that's similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they're collaborative, they're humble, they're open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they're going to ... They're a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I'm very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you're interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that's all about teaching.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah, exactly.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You've got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio's space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Like the physical environment?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Oh, wow.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I'll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it's so messy ... There's just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there's work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it's, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I've been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they're, like, the interior design is incredible, it's super high-end. They've got the best hardware, they've got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there's nothing on the walls that wasn't intended to be there, and the way it's designed, it's not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.
<br><br>
It's an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there's critical discourse that's guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that's not productive. There's a way to do a critique well.
<br><br>
Then, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that's a strong signal you've got a healthy culture, and that's a place where people can grow. I've talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I've mentored designers as, you know, now that I'm not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that's a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it's messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback's important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It's also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they're going to sense it, they're going to feel it, and they're going to want to be part of that environment.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let's say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don't have somebody dedicated. They don't have a VP of Design Education there. They don't have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they're learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it's very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it's also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don't have to have an agenda, you're not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You're just getting to know people, because making great work, it's not a solitary thing, for most of us. It's a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they're going to get deselected. They're going to get let go from their team, because if you can't work with other people, you can't actually do good work, ultimately. You've got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I'm fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We're trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It's with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it's just aarron ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>... and my website is <a href=" aarronwalter.com">aarronwalter.com</a>, so ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt>
<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.
</dd>

<dt>Aarron </dt>
<dd>Yeah, thank you!
</dd>

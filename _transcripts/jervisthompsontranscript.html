<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Jervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you're teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Oh yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Right? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
If you're a teacher and a student's sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you're taking control away from the student and they're becoming the observer. They're not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don't touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it's a better learning experience for them. Because there's many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I'm just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn't have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah, I got you. You're pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that's just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I love that.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yes. It's pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Right. That's awesome. That has always stuck with me. It's such a small thing but every time I'm trying to show someone something, I make sure I'm backed up. I'm not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it's so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
I think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can't just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Interesting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You're still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Sure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I've been there since 99.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's a long time.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Oh yeah. Loving every minute of it.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Just so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody's pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What did I ask you?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
I don't know the exact question. It wasn't 1. It wasn't 2. It was 3.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's funny. Wow. I don't even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Back in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn't too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it's currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.
<br><br>
It still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won't run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
How do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Because I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it's all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Business expense.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yeah. I love to learn. For me, it's not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Do you feel like there are certain things that you can't learn?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Can't learn. That's very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There's an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I'm a little bit jealous but that's one thing I can't do or I'm not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don't think I'm a creative artist but I am a code artist.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Oh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What's the key then? Because you've taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that's like, "I only HTML but I don't feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
All right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it's pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it's a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there's 3 languages. There's C sharp.
<br><br>
There's JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven't used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What do you mean when you say pseudo code?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Pseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you're comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I'm going to run a loop. I'm just going to write out whatever I'm comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Cool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Wow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.
<br><br>
From there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That's how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.
<br><br>
They were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we're going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
From there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn't want to lose me. I've been doing both ever since just learning as I go.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
How important do you think that is because there's that whole age old saying about those who can't teach? As long as I've known you and as you've said longer than that, you've both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that's important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
My personal opinion is you can't do one without the other.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Why's that?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Because yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it's hard to explain to somebody who doesn't. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn't understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you're teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there's some nuances that you just won't read in the book.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Put you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
All right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don't have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you're not familiar with. For example, I'm into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Oh man. That's awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Me personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn't in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn't know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That's where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn't familiar with because it wasn't in the lesson plan.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
When you have teachers that are more effective, I don't want to say there are bad teachers because that's politically incorrect.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. Got you.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Some teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Some students can't stand me as a teacher because I'm too strict or I'm not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he's a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
My rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can't take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don't take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you're too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student's learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There's some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you're sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you're comfortable teaching.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
One you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don't. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that's why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they're not bored sitting in the classroom.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You don't let anybody coast?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
No. You know that.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I do but what ...
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
No, I don't coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they're out in the real world. You don't want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B's and the C's and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you're lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. Got you.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yeah. I don't like cutting any slack. They don't like it but I've had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I'm glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that's a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
I know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don't do the bare minimum, I've seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn't just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that's a maturity level thing. Sometimes that's just getting familiar with college.
<br><br>
I also often tell my students that your career doesn't start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that's when you're learning your skill set. That's when you're building your resume. That's when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn't hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don't get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Grad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they're going for digital media master's, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There's less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. It's more open-ended on the grad side?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yes. It's more of a challenge on them because I'm not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can't walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that's more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they're going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they're up to speed.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we're talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
I did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Phil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I'm like, "Wow. That's pretty cool."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
I would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they're not going to know everything that you know so don't take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I'm not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I'm going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don't touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they're really good at writing but ...
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Interesting.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Praise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they'd be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It's not all just web development. There's other things. You've got emails. You've got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you're going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
I love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You're awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Why thank you sir.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Can people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What's the best way for them to get in touch with you?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Jervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome. You're on Twitter too, right?
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
Yup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Making it easy.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
No problem.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.
</dd>

<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>
You're very welcome, D Mall. Anytime.
</dd>

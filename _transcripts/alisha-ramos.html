		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve actually told anyone this, mostly because I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@alishalisha/coding-is-a-privilege-5a592e7d94d7#.tghgc7y8a">Coding is a Privilege</a> is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. It was a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have humanities majors, they can&rsquo;t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps like <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>, and the focus of the piece was these people didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great 6-figure jobs as engineers.</p>

		<p>(Laughs) It was a very positive piece. I read it, and I was like, &ldquo;Okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding inequality and privilege,&rdquo; and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated because those programs are becoming really popular now, and it&rsquo;s being sold in that way, right? You&rsquo;re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom: you get a $100,000 salary as an engineer.</p>

		<p>You think that&rsquo;s not true? You think that doesn&rsquo;t happen?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">

		<p>Definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I personally know of people where it&rsquo;s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren&rsquo;t quite honest about is, they don&rsquo;t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. It&rsquo;s really unclear. The kind of quality, the bar of quality really varies from program to program. I think you can certainly learn coding in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become a great engineer or a great designer.</p>

		<p>I definitely have problems with the way that they&rsquo;re packaging it, but I think more so than that, the price tag that is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It&rsquo;s a pretty high cost.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t start working in tech or I didn&rsquo;t start as an engineer. I used to work as a consultant. I graduated with a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, because it just wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea after about a year. I took a 6-month break to do some soul-searching and some design portfolio creating because this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I&rsquo;ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, but I just simply didn&rsquo;t have the money to pay for it. I wondered, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. They want this mobility from a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay $11,000&hellip; that&rsquo;s a lot to ask.</p>

		<p>That was the main impetus for that.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Can you talk a little bit more about that? These schools are great. They&rsquo;re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Even just the cost of it: $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so in, in that article you give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. What does somebody do instead of saying, &rdquo;Okay, I want to be an engineer. I don&rsquo;t have $11,000. What do I do instead?&rdquo; I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, but maybe don&rsquo;t know what to do about that. Maybe you  can share some thoughts about what we all can do?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Yeah, definitely. I did write <a href="https://medium.com/@alishalisha/coding-is-a-privilege-part-2-what-can-you-do-about-it-134b4989864d#.b01qjbmlm">a followup article</a> to that piece because I think a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, &ldquo;There are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. If you really want to learn, you can learn.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And, my response was, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It&rsquo;s more of a systemic problem.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as something that should be taught in schools from an early age. It shouldn&rsquo;t be kept from kids who might not be in a great school district. Beyond that, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. I think I was really lucky because I didn&rsquo;t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness that the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case for a lot of people, especially young people. They&rsquo;re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them succeeding and going into engineering, so they just don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s an option. I think that&rsquo;s really the biggest barrier to entry.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Gotcha. I want to go back to one thing that you said just a minute ago. You said it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Why does it take a long time and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks and all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>To become a great designer or a great engineer&mdash;and this is something I&rsquo;ve learned over the past few years that I&rsquo;ve been working now&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than the skills that you have. It&rsquo;s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It&rsquo;s about trusting your team. It&rsquo;s about garnering trust within your team. It&rsquo;s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb interface or whatever in <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>. Like, you could be a Sketch master but still be a poor designer because you just don&rsquo;t know how to read people or interact with them, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it&rsquo;s hard, but you certainly need those hard skills, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.</p>

		<p>Now, you work at <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com/pages/about-vox-media">Vox</a>. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do and how that all plays into your work? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers or other engineers there?</p>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, primarily on revenue platforms, and I&rsquo;ve been there for a little over two years now. Currently we don&rsquo;t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. I know we&rsquo;ve been talking about it, but it hasn&rsquo;t really been anything formal, and to be honest, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. I worked at this place called <a href="https://www.prophet.com/home">Prophet</a>. It was a brand strategy consulting firm and as most consulting firms go, it was very bureaucratic and organized, and I had a formal mentor there&mdash;I hope she doesn&rsquo;t listen to this podcast&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. I think I&rsquo;ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the two? Maybe you can explain that. What&rsquo;s the difference between formal mentorship and informal? How does that make a difference for you?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>I would describe a formal mentorship as a person or a program where you&rsquo;re assigned a mentor, like, &ldquo;Hey, this person&rsquo;s gonna show you the ropes and all of that.&rdquo; I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven&rsquo;t defined it as clearly with that other person. It&rsquo;s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you want to learn from and maybe even be like. I definitely have those people at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate challenges that I&rsquo;m facing with my team. I feel like it&rsquo;s really awkward to go to someone or to know someone and be like, &ldquo;Hello and dear sir or madam. Would you like to be my mentor?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="transcriptContents">

	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve participated. I&rsquo;ve signed up for mentorship programs&mdash;usually alumni programs&mdash;from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don&rsquo;t know. It, it hasn&rsquo;t really worked out well yet. I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful.</p>

		<p>What about internships? How does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and mentorship and all of that kind of stuff?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>I think internships are amazing. I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don&rsquo;t think I learned hard skills during internships that have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. I had one internship at a venture capital firm after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me learn how to work in a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire so it&rsquo;s just things like that. I don&rsquo;t think I have any hard skills, but I think they&rsquo;re still valuable for learning just how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.</p>

		<p>I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. First, because we really need the extra hand (laughs) and the help. I don&rsquo;t think an internship would be valuable to anyone if they&rsquo;re kind of just doing busy work or side work. I think it would be valuable for both parties if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, &ldquo;Hey, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship.

		<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing I want to come back to which you mentioned earlier, which I&rsquo;m very curious about. You said, &ldquo;Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection.&rdquo; Just in that itself, I think that&rsquo;s an interesting thought, that access is a form of fortune. It&rsquo;s not something we could take for granted. The other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.</p>

		<p>I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, &lsquo;Hey, you should poke around with this.&rsquo;&rdquo; I feel like that&rsquo;s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Well, I wish luck didn&rsquo;t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Looking back&mdash;and not to get super mushy or emotional&mdash;everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most life-changing things that&rsquo;s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>, and if you don&rsquo;t know my back story, it&rsquo;s just like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, whatever, you went to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League">Ivy League</a> school.&rdquo; But knowing my own history and my background, I didn&rsquo;t grow up with a lot of money. Both my parents are first generation immigrants; they don&rsquo;t speak English very well. Everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that&rsquo;s opposite of Harvard (laughs), but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that there&rsquo;s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now because I have the Internet. I went on a bunch of weird college forums to figure out, &ldquo;How do I apply to a college? What do I need?&rdquo; My parents didn&rsquo;t know that and they didn&rsquo;t know how to guide me through that. It changed my life. It opened so many doors and opportunities.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Wow. I&rsquo;m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here. I know that you send out <a href="http://tinyletter.com/mixedfeelings" title="&ldquo;Mixed Feelings,&rdquo; a newsletter about mixed identity and personal reflections by Alisha Ramos">a newsletter</a> ever ever so frequently about being mixed race. What role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech? (laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>That&rsquo;s a great question. I think that&rsquo;s a wonderful question. It&rsquo;s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Those are all really closely linked for me because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, what happens when you don&rsquo;t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field? It certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether they&rsquo;re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman, excelling in your field because it says to you, &ldquo;Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.&rdquo;</p>
	</div>
</div>


<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>That&rsquo;s so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching? What advice would you give them? Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, &ldqou;I have stuff that I can teach, but I don&rsquo;t know who to teach or where to find them.&rdquo; What, what should those people do?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Alisha</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>For teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, particularly those that focus on under-represented communities in tech, like <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code 2040</a>. There are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch because they&rsquo;re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks.</p> 

		<p>In terms of wanting to learn, I read this amazing article on HBR. It&rsquo;s called&mdash;this is more specifically talking to women who want to learn&mdash;<a href="https://hbr.org/2010/08/women-are-over-mentored-but-un">Women Are Over-Mentored (But Under-Sponsored)</a>.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>Wow.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="transcriptContents">
	<h3 class="transcriptContents-speakerHeading">Dan</h3>
	<div class="transcriptContents-speakerText">
		<p>I read that article, and I was like, &ldquo;Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around.&rdquo; (laughs). The main focus of the article is that a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it&rsquo;s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion or anything like that, so it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor, to find a sponsor.</p>

		<p>This article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, &ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; and nodded my head. Now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yes, this is so true.&rdquo; You really should find someone higher up in your organization who can guide you and fight for you for a promotion or a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that&rsquo;ll give you more visibility because there really is a gender difference. Women and men both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, moreso than women, and that&rsquo;s just fascinating. I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but is that really what women need? Maybe they need something that translates into something more real.</p>

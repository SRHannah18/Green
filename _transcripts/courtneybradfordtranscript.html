Hi Courtney.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Hey Dan.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You've had a really interesting start to your career, which is that somebody gave you a chance and you started through a really intense apprenticeship. Can you talk a little bit about that, and tell us about what that looked like, and what that experience was like for you?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah, definitely. I'm happy to do that. For me, a definitely interesting approach. I was asked a lot when you're first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn't. My response to that normally was, "Didn't go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Knowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You're going to need to run Windows for this course."
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
I was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn't have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
No.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
What was the criteria?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
The criteria, there really wasn't. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn't something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn't know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
It was small, small pool. You're right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I've done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we're talking I had Photoshop.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
I had a couple books.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
You had a Macbook.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn't just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can't completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Sorry. Did you say that it was not paid?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. The internship was not paid.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Got you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Exactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I'm not being paid, but they're investing time and resources into me. I'm not paying for college classes right now.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn't have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
I think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don't have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you're reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let's see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.
<br><br>

It was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You're writing actual code. You're working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here's my design. What do you think? It's cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here's the design, what do you think about it? Here's why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Awesome.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I'd say 70% dedicated to web, but it's college age. You're trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Actually, both of them did teach part-time.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Okay.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. There's a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It's not a state school. It's a smaller private school. I'm getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There's a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren't. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren't teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool. What happens next in the story? You're working at a coffee shop. You're going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we're doing. When you're learning, you're not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren't just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.
<br><br>

That was the first time ... Again, weren't paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I'm not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.
<br><br>

At the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you're working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that's the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you've got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. That's exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
That's so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Pretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven't changed what I've done for about six years. Hopefully, I'm a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I'm doing what I like. It's fun.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Very cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
One thing we didn't talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Wow.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Even simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don't work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We're a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Nice. Now, do you have interns? If you don't, one day do you think you will?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Definitely. I don't right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I'm about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that's inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn't see any other options.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah, it's pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you're doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there's cheap labor in there too, but there's got to be something more than that, right?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. I don't want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren't going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can't promise that that's the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone's interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Yeah. That's so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Yeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.
</dd>

<dt>Dan </dt><dd>
Thanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.
</dd>

<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>
Thanks. You too, Dan.

Patiyali is on the banks of the river Ganga. It is in India&#8217;s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Patiyali was laid back and idyllic, with no real opportunities in IT or computers. My father never wanted me to go for IT Job because I wouldn&#8217;t get chance to work near my town. He preferred I live closer home.</p>\n<p>My mother supported me and somehow she convinced my father to let me follow my dreams. Thanks to my mother; she has always supported me, without her I would not be here.</p>\n<p>In my college there was choice between Dot Net and Java, I choose Java. I have always been fan of Open Source. I loved Java, I had also started my blog on Java in my college time. After completing my MCA I had joined my first Job as a Java Developer. I did it for 1.5 years.</p>\n<p>I never wanted to quit my job as Java Developer, but I had to because of my sister health issues. Doctors said she would not survive, it was very critical time.</p>\n<h3>How I got into WordPress (Hello WordPress!)</h3>\n<p>Unemployed for 6 months, Java was still on my mind. I could not get any Job. Meantime I had started teaching. I was hopeless, I thought I would never get a chance to work in any IT company again. Then a friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/ankitguptaindia">Ankit</a>, who worked in <a href="https://rtcamp.com/">rtCamp</a>, a company based in Pune told me to look up WordPress and asked me to apply for a QA opening. That lucky day I got call from rtCamp and cleared my interview. Now the challenge was to convince my parents to allow me to go Pune. Pune is in Maharashtra, almost 1000 miles away from my hometown.</p>\n<p>My parents are from a smaller town, they were worried about me living alone in a big city. It was a challenge to convince them to let go.</p>\n<p>Some things they worried about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place to stay: It was too tough to find a place when I had no one in Pune.</li>\n<li>Female Count: My mother was most worried about female count. rtCamp had only two female employees including me. (now they have 7)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before my first day, my father and I went to rtCamp&#8217;s address and looked up the office. Convinced the neighborhood where it was located was semi-residential and safe, he felt much better about Pune.</p>\n<h3>But WordPress is just a blogging platform</h3>\n<p>Before joining rtCamp I had known WordPress as only a blogging platform. My friends who worked in MNCs usually dismissed it as a blogging platform that could create only static sites at best. I did not have a very different opinion than my friends.</p>\n<p>Working in rtCamp was fun. I made friends but to be honest I did not find WordPress very interesting for the first six months in the beginning.</p>\n<h3>WordPress community called out to me</h3>\n<p>Then I saw my colleagues involved in the WordPress community as Core contributors and in many other ways. I saw how my company was encouraging people to get involved in community.</p>\n<p>That encouraged me to get involved in with <a href="http://make.wordpress.org">make.WordPress.org</a>. I highly recommend you do that too.</p>\n<h3>First Contribution Core Patch</h3>\n<p>My first contribution was a small patch in the core. I was helped by colleagues and when it was accepted I was thrilled. Now something I did was on millions of websites. It might be a small line or two but still it was on millions of websites.</p>\n<p>In September 2015, I took part in WordCamp Pune. It was my first WordCamp. I met so many wonderful people; <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/making-family/">Topher</a>, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/breaking-the-silence/">Mahangu</a>, <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/finding-hope-darkness/">Raghavendra Satish Peri</a>, I got to learn so many new things from them.</p>\n<p>I try to contribute (Giving back to community) in every possible way, by giving support, translating, Review themes, and documentation.</p>\n<h3>Theme Review</h3>\n<p>Theme review was the challenge for me as I had no idea about WordPress development so I thought to learn by seeing other people&#8217;s code. It was challenge for me because I am QA (non- WordPress Developer), other people assume that we can not get involved in any code related activity. I learned a lot by reviewing themes, every day I review a theme I learn so many new things. The theme review team is wonderful, there are so many wonderful people like <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinHaig">Kevin Archibald</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinapoena">Carolina Nymark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kenshino">Jon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nilambar">Nilambar</a>, who are ready to help you always. I am happy to be part of theme review team.</p>\n<p>I love WordPress, it&#8217;s wonderful, it has wonderful community.</p>\n<h3>Why do I love being part of WordPress?</h3>\n<p>Recognition.</p>\n<p>I have always been crazy for being known for something. In college time when I used to get likes for my blog post or any comment, I used to feel like…&#8230;wow, I can not even express that feeling in words. So that feeling WordPress gives me every time I gets mention in any WP.org posts. It gives me recognition.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/06/28/thank-you-reviewers-2/">https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/06/28/thank-you-reviewers-2/</a><br />\n<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2016/07/12/summary-for-helphub-meeting-12-july/">https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2016/07/12/summary-for-helphub-meeting-12-july/</a><br />\n<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/week-in-core-sept-13-21-2015/">http://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/week-in-core-sept-13-21-2015/</a><br />\n<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/contributor-weekend-one-hour-video/">https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/contributor-weekend-one-hour-video/</a></p>\n<h3>A Thank You Note</h3>\n<p>All this wonderful adventure would not have been possible without someone back in Patiyali, who stood up for me and encouraged me to follow my dreams.

It&#8217;s a rough, organic, and hugely important process. In fact, open source represented $143 million <a href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/open-source-was-worth-at-least-143m-of-instagram-s-1b-acquisition-808bb85e4681">of Instagram’s $1 billion acquisition</a>. Yet the role of open source as economic infrastructure <a href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/funding-digital-infrastructure-8b1bf8b8e4cb">is perilous at best</a> — the next <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> could be any day. Bridges don&#8217;t collapse often, but sustainably maintained open source projects are few and far between. Unless a project has the backing of a benevolent organization, it’s all too easy to <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/752973741781463040">fall into a state of disrepair</a>.</p>\n<p>I do my part by volunteering several hours each week to maintain an open source project called <a href="https://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a>. Last November, I launched a Kickstarter project titled “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli">A more RESTful WP-CLI</a>” to provide a way for me, a <a href="https://handbuilt.co/">self-employed freelancer</a>, to spend a large amount of dedicated time on WP-CLI and the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress REST API</a>. The funding wrapped up last month, so I thought it might be helpful to provide a retrospective on what worked, what I’d improve upon next time, and where I think this is all headed.</p>\n<h3>We all love #shipping</h3>\n<p>As a very brief summary of how I used the money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over seven months, I spent 226 total hours on WP-CLI (150 of which were funded by the Kickstarter project) and 111 total hours on the WordPress REST API (92 of which were funded by the Kickstarter project).</li>\n<li>I shipped three major versions of WP-CLI, and helped with three releases of the WordPress REST API v2 plugin.</li>\n<li>In each release, I personally introduced dozens of new features to each project, fixed ten times as many bugs, provided code review, answered support questions, and revised documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://wp-cli.org/restful/">very complete project landing page</a> if you’d like to go through all of the details.</p>\n<h3>“I’d love to get paid to work on open source too”</h3>\n<p>On the surface, using Kickstarter seems like a great way to fund open source involvement: create a campaign, people give you money, and you get paid to work on your project. It&#8217;s actually fraught with challenges, though. The more appropriate way to think about using Kickstarter for open source is that you&#8217;re creating a one-time project for yourself, and have hundreds of customers to serve.</p>\n<h4>Kickstarter can help freelancers make significant open source contributions</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth highlighting the single most important outcome of the crowdfunding campaign: I was able to spend dedicated time on WP-CLI and the WordPress REST API that I wouldn’t have been able to spend otherwise (or at least in such a concentrated period).</p>\n<p>As a freelancer, I evaluate every hour of my working day as either billable or non-billable. While I&#8217;m fortunate I can already spend a large amount of non-billable time as I please, at the end of the day the time I don&#8217;t spend on billable hours is money out of my pocket. Kickstarter enabled me to consider open source contributions as billable, and rationalize dedicating a large number of hours each week to the projects.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, the timing of the Kickstarter project turned out really well too. Because I didn&#8217;t have any clients when I quit my full-time job, the funds were a helpful cushion during the slow holiday period, and I had something to work on in January.</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s important to have backers with deep pockets</h4>\n<p>Incorporating higher contribution levels, which I had primed by chatting with prospective backers in advance, meant the funding leapt forward in huge bounds. Every time one of those contributions came in, it moved the needle in a substantial way, and kept the excitement level up. This also helped keep lower level contributors engaged and willing to participate. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to try and fund a Kickstarter exclusively on sub-$100 contributions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/profiles/ben-welch-bolen/">Ben Welch-Bolen</a>, who I hadn&#8217;t met until he snagged the top contribution slot, explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What attracted us to the WP CLI Kickstarter project was the higher pledge options that had some meaningful exposure for us to his community, and to him as a resource. Plus it was great to give back to a tool we use ourselves and follow closely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I consider myself fortunate to have an existing audience willing to financially back my open source contributions. Because of my track record, I was able to put my own social capital on the line as collateral, to “guarantee” the project. <span class="pullquote alignright">If you can’t name fifty people who would realistically fund your project, then you’ll need to have a substantial marketing budget (of time or money) to raise awareness.</span></p>\n<h4>Scope in open source is a double-edged sword</h4>\n<p>While I had an established objective for the Kickstarter, I didn’t have a clearly defined scope. This meant that some intermediate implementation details blocked later features. For instance, you can’t use <a href="https://github.com/wp-cli/restful">RESTful WP-CLI</a> to manage menus, because the menu endpoints don’t yet exist in the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>At the same time, not having a super defined scope meant I could take the liberty to spend some of the time on what I thought was most useful. WP-CLI package management and the documentation portal essentially launched because I burned out working on the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<h4>Crowdfunding requires a certain type of personality</h4>\n<p>As far as honoring my commitments to my backers goes, I’d consider my Kickstarter a success. I did what I said I was going to do, on the schedule I communicated. I was able to do this, in part, because I’m a very meticulous person. I produce reasonably accurate estimates, keep track of how I spend my time, and over-communicate with stakeholders.</p>\n<p>If this doesn’t sound like you, then crowdfunding might not be a great fit. As a freelancer, you need to know in advance how the work will fit alongside client commitments. As a full-time employee, you need to make sure you&#8217;re capable of completing the project on nights and weekends.</p>\n<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/profiles/joshua-strebel/">Josh Strebel</a>, to whom I&#8217;m thankful for a great deal of early feedback, thinks:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The open source community is primarily reputation based, WordPress especially. Getting a campaign funded on Kickstarter is about trust. Trust and reputation are shades of the same color so to speak. If you build a reputation of trust, launching and promoting a Kickstarter project should be fairly easy as your peers trust you to execute against your stated goals (their money is used for it’s stated intent and appears to achieve the desired outcome). I do not think you can reverse the order, the reputation in the community must be cultivated prior to seeking funds.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One huge challenge with a Kickstarter project is that you have to do all of the work after you receive the money, which can be really difficult for procrastinators. <span class="pullquote alignright">You&#8217;re also faced with dozens of stakeholders to make happy, with your credibility and reputation on the line, so you need to make sure they’re regularly kept in the loop.</span></p>\n<h4>Most of what goes into open source isn’t very sexy</h4>\n<p>Contributing to open source isn’t just cranking out lines of code.</p>\n<p>I spent a huge amount of the funded WordPress REST API time on discussion, code review, and support. These maintenance tasks aren’t very appealing for crowdfunding, and probably wouldn’t make it very far as a part of a Kickstarter project. People want to fund sexy new features, not bug fixes, maintenance, documentation, etc.</p>\n<p>At the same time, this type of work is hugely expensive, and represents a substantial majority of the effort involved in maintaining an open source project.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://poststatus.com/profiles/josh-koenig/">Josh Koenig</a> has a healthy understanding of where open source fits into his business:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe that open source software is a crucial part of the internet&#8217;s value proposition to humanity. However, at this stage in the development of our company, investments in open source have to be strategic. Any sustained contribution we make has to be justifiable in terms of hour it helps us improve our platform or grow our business.</p>\n<p>As such our primary code and sponsorship contributions tend to be down the stack, to projects or libraries that we depend on to run our platform. When it comes to WordPress or Drupal, we typically contribute in ways that will have the most impact for our core audience: professional developers. So that means tools and utilities like WP-CLI, Redis or Solr integration, diagnostic tools, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<h4>Simplicity means more time spent on the project</h4>\n<p>On the practical side, offering consulting-time rewards instead of physical swag helped me keep reward costs manageable. Only two-thirds of backers redeemed their rewards, so I spent a total of 41.25 hours on that part of the project.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, <a href="https://poststatus.com/profiles/jason-resnick/">Jason Resnick</a> even appreciated the open-ended approach to rewards:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The best part of the project was the ability to choose my own path, so to speak. Kind of like those Choose Your Own Adventure books when you were a kid. WP-CLI can be used in so many different ways for different tasks, it was awesome to be able to just hop on a call with you and one or two other folks that also wanted to learn the same thing, and get the answers to the specific questions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It also proved helpful to produce a landing page for the project with the overall goal, links to blog posts and milestones, and over-communication on how I was “spending” the money. In hindsight, I wish I had been more diligent about my progress updates and communication about what I was actually working on.</p>\n<p>My favorite production trick: I used HTML and CSS to produce a graphic in my browser, and took a screenshot of it &#8212; quite possibly the easiest way to create a Kickstarter header image, for you other non-designers.</p>\n<h3>Kickstarter is only the beginning</h3>\n<p>Kickstarter is an amazing platform for funding creativity. The next time I launch a crowdfunding project, I&#8217;ll make sure to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get feedback on the idea from as many people as possible, as a way of generating interest and buy-in.</li>\n<li>Establish a project scope with features people want, while making sure there&#8217;s ample budget for the unglamorous work.</li>\n<li>Keep the rewards rewarding, and as simple to deliver as possible.</li>\n<li>Over-communicate progress, knowing I have hundreds of customers to make happy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the case of WP-CLI, <a href="https://runcommand.io/">runcommand</a> is my new company to pick up where Kickstarter leaves off.</p>\n<p>An increasing number of businesses use WP-CLI as a key part of their infrastructure. Right now, each business has to internalize much of the cost associated with creating WP-CLI-based features. For instance, many web hosts would benefit from offering a web browser interface for running WP-CLI commands. However, there isn&#8217;t yet a great way for them to collaborate and produce a common solution.</p>\n<p><a href="https://runcommand.io/">runcommand</a> provides a platform for these businesses to <a href="https://runcommand.io/sparks/">co-produce a shared open source roadmap</a>, and offload much of the burden of developing and maintaining infrastructural components.</p>\n<p>Thinking about using Kickstarter to fund your open source projects?

Miller and Danner, who often have casual chats about business strategy, decided to start recording their conversations to share with others who might benefit from their mistakes and successes in entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to talk about values, beliefs, philosophies, tools, all kinds of things that we have learned over the years, either accidentally or on purpose, about how to lead and manage teams and grow a business,&#8221; Miller said in the opening episode.</p>\n<p>Leader.team will feature a short (15-25 minute) episode twice a month on Thursdays with practical advice for leaders and managers. The second episode will be available tomorrow, and Miller and Danner have already outlined the topics for the next four episodes with questions that will guide the discussion on the show:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Beliefs, Values, Philosophies We Hold Dear</li>\n<li>The Culture We Cherish And Protect</li>\n<li>Finding, Recruiting and Hiring the Best People</li>\n<li>Leading a Hybrid Team of In-Office and Remote Team Members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Miller and Danner are not necessarily marketing the show as a WordPress-focused podcast, many of their shared experiences have come from growing one of the longest-running, successful product companies in the WordPress ecosystem. Upcoming episodes will feature big picture business topics that can be applied to many different types of industries. Leader.team episodes have been submitted to both iTunes and Google Play and will also be available on the show&#8217;s <a href="http://leader.team/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 22:19:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"WPTavern: WordPress for Android 5.6 Adds Screen to Invite New Users, Expands Reader to Include Related Posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=58328";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-6-adds-screen-to-invite-new-users-expands-reader-to-include-related-posts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2114:"<p><a href="https://apps.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/wordpress-for-android-version-5-6/" target="_blank">Version 5.6</a> of the WordPress for Android app was released today with expanded features for WordPress.com sites.

A publish button is added on drafts.</li>\n<li>“View Site” and “View Admin” will now open the device browser.</li>\n<li>A comment is automatically approved when you reply to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use the app to manage both WordPress.com and self-hosted sites, you will notice a growing discrepancy between the site management screens and options available for each. Self-hosted site owners still cannot use the app to manage themes or users, and the gap is widening for each release. Version 5.6 expands features for WordPress.com users, while the capabilities for self-hosted sites fall further behind. We have requested a comment from Automattic&#8217;s mobile engineers regarding the roadmap for managing self-hosted sites and will update when we receive a response.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 20:19:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: IncludeWP: A Directory That Caters to WordPress Frameworks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://wptavern.com?p=58222&preview_id=58222";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://wptavern.com/includewp-a-directory-that-caters-to-wordpress-frameworks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3745:"<p>Earlier this year, the WordPress plugin directory review team <a href="https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-will-no-longer-accept-frameworks">reminded developers</a> that frameworks are not allowed in the directory. WordPress core doesn&#8217;t have a built-in way to support plugin dependencies which creates extra hassle for users.</p>\n<p>Seeing an opportunity, Vova Feldman, founder of Freemius, created <a href="https://includewp.com/">IncludeWP</a>, a directory specifically catered to listing WordPress theme and plugin frameworks.</p>\n<img class="wp-image-58242 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IncludeWPFrontpage.png?resize=1007%2C690&ssl=1" alt="IncludeWPFrontpage.png" />IncludeWP Front Page Displaying Theme and Plugin Frameworks\n<p>Frameworks are listed using their public GitHub repositories. Visitors can sort frameworks by stars, forks, issues, or name. Selecting a framework displays information including, how many sites it&#8217;s on and the number of plugins and themes hosted on the official directory that are using it.</p>\n<img class="wp-image-58259 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IncludeWPSinglePageView.png?resize=1014%2C664&ssl=1" alt="IncludeWPSinglePageView.png" />IncludeWP Framework Single Page View\n<p>To identify which plugins and themes are used by frameworks, Feldman collaborated with Luca Fracassi of <a href="https://addendio.com">Addendio</a>. &#8220;We realized that we can leverage the WordPress.org APIs and SVN to automatically identify plugins and themes associated with frameworks on WordPress.org,&#8221; Feldman said. &#8220;So we decided to join forces.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fracassi developed a framework identification system and ran it against WordPress.org. The data was exposed via a custom API endpoint that allowed Feldman to display it on IncludeWP. &#8220;We leveraged Fracassi&#8217;s endpoint to fetch the plugins and themes data from WordPress.org and present it under the framework’s page,&#8221; Feldman said.</p>\n<p>Like the frameworks listed on IncludeWP, the code powering the site is open source and <a href="https://github.com/Freemius/IncludeWP">available on GitHub</a>. &#8220;I’m preaching about code reusability,&#8221; Feldman said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The least I can do is provide the option for other developers to reuse our code for their projects. By reusing this code base, everyone can easily create a similar category type listing mini-site for GitHub repos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers interested in having their frameworks listed need to fork the <a href="https://github.com/Freemius/IncludeWP">IncludeWP repository</a> on GitHub, add the framework as a .php in the src/frameworks folder, and submit a Pull Request. However, in order to be listed, frameworks must meet the following guidelines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The framework must be GPL Licensed.</li>\n<li>The framework must have a public repository on GitHub</li>\n<li>Complete each field in the src/frameworks area</li>\n<li>Add a reference to the plugin or theme&#8217;s slug if it&#8217;s hosted on WordPress.org</li>\n<li>Have a short description</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feldman says he doesn&#8217;t plan on generating revenue through the site and considers IncludeWP as one of many contributions back to the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>IncludeWP is a great resource for developers whose frameworks are spread across GitHub who are looking for ways to generate more exposure. It&#8217;s also an excellent way to see what&#8217;s available in the WordPress ecosystem. Take a look around <a href="https://includewp.com/">IncludeWP</a> and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 15:07:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"HeroPress: 16 Little Things That Grew Into Big Things (My Life in a Bunch of Words)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1177";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://heropress.com/essays/16-little-things-grew-into-big-things/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34430:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/072616-16-2-little-things-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pill quote:WordCamp was not a conference, it was a sharing of ideas.

I suspect that most readers here will not remember these, but the one I had gotten was the race car game. It was a game with a button that slid only left and right, the goal to be to dodge the oncoming LEDs with the LED you controlled with the slider. It was a simple game but fun. I brought it to school and started charging people .25 per game to play. I averaged $9.00 a day. That’s a lot to a fifth grader. I learned about profit and expenses (batteries do, after all, cost money). I learned about friendly competition when a friend of mine and classmate brought his electronic handheld football game to school and charged .50 per game. I learned about volume sales (my game would last about a minute or two whereas the football game lasted substantially longer). I also learned about charging what the market would bear (I couldn’t get .50 per game but I could do .25 all day long). And lastly, I learned about “The Man” and how something that is going so well can go away in the blink of an eye when the school, after about a month of my enterprise, decided that these games were too much of a distraction to “real learning” and shut both myself and my competitor down.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Little did the school know that I learned more with my business experience in that short time than I did my whole fifth grade year</p></blockquote>\n<p>(it was my worst experience in elementary school, yet one of my most formative). When all was said and done, though, I had made a couple hundred dollars from a game that cost about $40 (which I hadn’t even paid for). Not a bad return.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #2</h3>\n<p>In High School economics class, we learned how the stock market worked. We split the class into several groups and formed “corporations.” The members of these corporations then bought stock with real money. This money went to buy product that we would sell to the student body over a period of a couple weeks. I had been asked to be a member of the one corporation due to a previous simulation in which I had almost successfully beaten another team by coordinating an uprising against them (the other team was far more powerful) by secretly putting several of the smaller, less powerful teams together to try to take out the big team. It almost worked. Almost.</p>\n<p>This team asked me to be part of this new corporation because they were impressed. We decided that the thing we were going to sell to the student body was going to be candy. I invested $9.00 into the company. Of the members of this newly formed team, I invested the most. We talked about what types of candy to buy. It mostly involved peanut butter cups and skittles as I recall.</p>\n<p>I don’t remember what the other corporations sold. It didn’t matter. It was not true competition because we each were exclusive with our products. During breaks, lunch, and after school, we all had our tables set up in the quad and sold our goods. Our corporation slaughtered all the others. It wasn’t even close.</p>\n<p>At the end of it all, we determined the stock value based on costs of goods sold and profit left over. We sold our stocks for what they were worth. My $9.00 had turned into about $75.00 in the two weeks. I made, far and away, more money than anyone else in the class (and according to the teacher, more than anyone ever had in that simulation). Making money was easy, and it was what I was meant to do. Or so I thought.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #3</h3>\n<p>Back to Fifth Grade. At the time, my best friend, Jack, had introduced me to Basic programming. My dad worked at a local University and as a result, the head of the Math &amp; Computing Department granted me a student account on the mainframe (their department was right across from my dad’s “Modern Languages” Department). It was here that I learned that a simple Basic statement such as “10 goto 10” could actually take down a campus-wide system as these mainframes were really not built to do multi-tasking. The joy of an endless loop. I hate to admit that there were times that I would laugh maniacally as other students in the lab would start literally banging their keyboards because nothing was happening. To all of you, I most humbly and heartily apologize. I was a jerk. I blame Jack.</p>\n<blockquote><p>None the less, I had been bitten by the programming bug.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I expanded my knowledge beyond causing others brain damage for fun and actually started to program useful things. My dad hired me at .50 an hour (which I’m pretty sure came out of his own pocket) and I worked on programs that would quiz his students. It’s also probable that he did it to keep me out of trouble.</p>\n<p>My brain wrapped itself around programming rather quickly and, as a general rule, every day after school, you’d find me back up in one of the University labs hacking away. It wasn’t a bad life. I liked it a lot. My favorite lab was the one right outside the server room. I got to know the students who kept the systems up. I remember when they got some new storage. I want to say it was a drive that could store 20 megabytes. It was literally as big (and heavy) as a washing machine. Oh. . . the good ol’ days.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #4</h3>\n<p>I believe it was during the summer between Eighth Grade and Ninth Grade (circa 1980-81) that a representative from a company called Commodore came and demonstrated this great new personal computer. It was better than a TRS80 and far more affordable than the Apple ][. It had color and a whopping 5 KB of RAM. That is pretty impressive. All you needed to do was hook it up to your TV. I don’t remember what I paid for it, but I knew this was the machine for me, so I ponied up with my hard-earned money for the computer that looked like nothing more than a keyboard and a tape drive. Before I knew it (well . . . four to six weeks later), I was a programming fool from the comfort of my own home. I could get used to this. It was a few months later that I had saved up enough for a 300 baud modem (If you don’t know what 300 baud is, let me explain: It’s SLOW) and learned how I could hook up to my account at the college. It was my first taste of remote work and I knew that, one day, it was going to be the life I’d be living. The world would just have to catch up (ya, I was just a scosche cocky back then).</p>\n<p>A year later, I upgraded to a Commodore 64 and purchased my first Commodore 1541 5.25” floppy drive. I learned about sprite graphics and created a game based on the Saturday Night Live character, “Mr. Bill.” The game totally sucked, but suffice it to say, Mr. Bill died a LOT at the hands of Sluggo. A LOT.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #5</h3>\n<p>Between my Junior and Senior years of high school, I was going to take a trip to Europe. I knew that Europe was no place to take my computers, and what I really needed was to make memories. I had always envied my sister’s camera and decided that it was time for me to dive into 35mm photography, so I sold my whole computer setup and purchased my first 35mm camera; a Canon AE1-Program with a couple of lenses and some books and accessories. I quickly learned how to actually use the thing and gained a basic understanding of the math behind the exposure you want. During that trip, I shot as many rolls of film as I could afford and discovered that maybe a life in photography was what I really wanted.</p>\n<p>I came back, my senior year, where I was the head photographer for the yearbook. I was rather proud of that yearbook and I put a lot of time and effort into it. So much so, that the yearbook staff felt obligated to give me an award. As mentioned earlier, in my younger years, I was sort of a jerk, so I cannot remember what the award was. At the time it meant a lot to me, though.</p>\n<p>I loved photography and I loved technology. If only there was some way to combine photography with technology. . . Maybe one day.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #6</h3>\n<p>After high school, I went to about one semester of College. I say, “about,” because I think the only class I regularly attended was the photography class I was taking. I really enjoyed the class and the teacher. But most of all, I enjoyed the full access to the dark room where I was the head know-it-all and all the other students came to me for assistance. My ego was riding pretty high around that time.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #7</h3>\n<p>After deciding to drop out of college (much to the chagrin of my dad &#8211; did I mention he was a University Professor?), I knew I needed to make money. I applied for (and got) a job with a company called Lifetouch National School Studios. Many of you might be familiar with this company. They specialize in school photography. I worked there for two school years, the first being an assistant and general runner and then the next year I did a lot of darkroom work. I was in my zone. I got to be good friends with a guy named Gene who was the world’s biggest Raiders fan and even got me a press pass a couple years later to shoot from the sidelines.</p>\n<blockquote><p>During that game, I met people like Howie Long, Bo Jackson and Bob Golic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I also met James Garner who got to stand by the bench because, well, he was James Garner. Incidentally, he was exactly what you’d have expected him to be. Gene also introduced me to the world of Santa Claus mall photography; possibly the worst job I ever had. No, I was not the Santa. I was the photographer. The problem was never the kids. It was always the parents. You try telling parents that their kid is hysterical, will never calm down, and will never smile for Santa because he or she is scared to death of the man with the beard. Or, maybe, try to find something to clean up the pee on the floor because some parent made their kid wait in line for two hours while he had to go to the bathroom (usually the two hours was because of a number of the aforementioned parents living in their dreamland of a smiling child). Or, having a parent make you tell their child that Santa has gone home for the day (because the parents waited until after the mall closed before they decided to get in line). All true stories. Ya &#8211; I only did it one Christmas. Ironically, I lasted longer than most.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #8</h3>\n<p>I quickly realized that I needed to be making more money and that commissioned sales was where I needed to be. I applied for (and got) a job at a company called Circuit City. They sold electronics of all sorts. I originally wanted to work in their Camera Department, only to discover that they didn’t have one. So, it was Small Electronics for me, where I quickly became Assistant Manager of the department.</p>\n<p>After cutting my teeth in electronics, I figured out that where I really wanted to be was in the Video Department. It’s where the money was. So I put in for a transfer and that’s where I got to be good friends with Gregg Franklin. Gregg and I forged a strong friendship and discovered that neither one of us ever really had a desire to work for “The Man,” so we decided to look for business opportunities. This was around 1987 or 1988.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #9</h3>\n<p>In 1989, Gregg and I decided to venture off from Circuit City and we bought a little camera store for $10,000.00. It had been around for a while and, honestly, neither one of us did much due diligence. Had we done so, we would have discovered the reputation the owner of the store had. We spent the next two years working on re-branding, building up a local reputation of supporting schools and professional photographers in the area, and eventually became a reputable business in town. The local photographers would come and chat for hours on end with us and we became friends with many who remain our friends to this day. During this time, we built a darkroom and did a lot of custom work.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a friend from school had started his own company in which he built custom PCs. It was time for me to return to the world of computing, where, after purchasing an XT PC running MS-DOS 2.0 (I believe), and a piece of database software called Q&amp;A, I developed a fully operational Point of Sale system. It was my first foray into data mining. I had finally figured out a way to combine my love of photography with my love for computing. It wasn’t what I initially imagined, but it would do.</p>\n<p>During the time of the camera store, I also started my own WWIV BBS called “The Dragon’s Tavern”, a precursor to the Internet. It had software and games (can you say, “Global Thermal Nuclear War?). At one point, I was the only one in the area with a BBS and ONE GIG of storage space. Modem tech had advanced and I got myself a USRobotics 14.4 Courier HST modem. I was the king of the local BBS world. WWIV was an open source BBS platform and I spent a lot of time writing mods for it in Turbo C++. I met people from all over the world and spent hours on the phone with some of them as we worked through programming issues and ideas. It was my first experience with remote collaboration.</p>\n<p>The camera store lasted a couple of years, but we suffered a bit from trying to do too much too fast, along with a failing economy, and we realized that our model was not really sustainable. Rather than getting buried under a mountain of debt, we made the choice to shut the place down.</p>\n<p>From there Gregg and I tried our hands at a few things, the most significant being a sign company (we had actually been running it as a side business from the camera story for some time, to help bolster our income). To be honest, I didn’t like that job that much. Gregg got to have all the fun doing the creative work, then he, our alcoholic partner who showed us the ropes, and myself would go and install them. Vinyl cutting was fun and the tech behind it still fascinates me, but it didn’t take long for us to learn that we were not the right fit with the third partner, so Gregg and I split from him.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #10</h3>\n<p>Fast forward a couple years. Gregg and I had been doing our own things separately for a while, trying to find our place in life. Owning and shutting down a couple of businesses does make you realize that you’re not as perfect as you think you are and may even be a bit of cause for some soul searching. I cannot speak for Gregg, but I know that for myself, that was the case.</p>\n<p>I was burnt out on photography.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Doing something for a couple of years for others and none for yourself sort of takes the passion out of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Running a free BBS was not exactly a business model that worked. I think it was around 1995 that I discovered Netcom. It was one of the first real internet providers. I bit. I was hooked. It was *like* a BBS but SO much more! The world had opened up to me and I saw my vision of one day becoming a remote worker come that much closer. Before long, a feeling had returned that I had not had in awhile: the desire to learn something new in technology. I wanted to gain an understanding of how the back end of this wondrous new tool worked. I knew it was the future, and it was within my grasp. It had been a while since I had been that excited about anything.</p>\n<p>It was then that Gregg and I reconnected. Gregg had told me that some other mutual friends of ours were about to embark on starting a regional Internet Service Provider, servicing schools and running a digital technology called ISDN. They had invested in the equipment but needed someone to run it. They had asked Gregg, and when I expressed interest, we formed a partnership and got to work. During this time, I learned about routers, IP traffic, DNS, collaboration with people on a global level, scalability, building departments and efficiently servicing customers through no more than email and a telephone connection. I learned about the value of good documentation and I learned how to deal with big, huge companies and their lawyers. I learned all of these things and yet, I wouldn’t say that any of those shaped my future and my life and business operating philosophy more than the epiphany I had once I hired our first employee.</p>\n<p>Until this point, I had always been about making money and a name for myself. It was ALWAYS about the money for me. Always. But I remember that moment like it was yesterday. That moment I looked at the empty desk of our first employee and realized that we were embarking on something great. We were building a company that would help sustain the lives of others and their families. If all went well, it wouldn’t be just a few. It would be many.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the blink of an eye, it went from being about me and what I could take home, to being about them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To being about us. All of us. That one moment changed everything for me.</p>\n<h3>Little (ok BIG) Thing #11</h3>\n<p>In 2003, my wife and I decided to move to Wisconsin from sunny Southern California. I was going to continue to work remotely with the ISP we had built up to over 40 employees and my wife Jessica was going to also work remotely with the Electronic Funds Transfer company she had worked to build up while in California (she was their first employee). Wisconsin was a nice break from the rat race of Southern California. We bought a house, set up our office and before I knew it, I discovered that the people back home at the ISP didn’t understand the concept of remote work. I was a shareholder of a company that had no use for me sitting a couple thousand miles away. Sure, from time to time they’d call me, but overall, out of sight meant out of mind where I was concerned.</p>\n<p>We moved to a pretty small town where we were happy to have high speed internet, but there was not a lot of demand for a network engineer or software programmer. I had, once again, found myself somewhat without a professional purpose.</p>\n<p>Soon after our first year there, we found out that Jessica was pregnant. Our main purpose in moving to Wisconsin was to start a family, but Jessica had always had issues carrying a pregnancy to full term. It was heartbreaking to deal with multiple miscarriages, but we had found a doctor in Green Bay (2.5 hours away) who thought he might be able to narrow down the issue. He was right, and nine months (and two weeks) later, we were introduced to our son, Eli. Hard to believe it’s been 11 years. And while I was struggling to find my place professionally, there was no doubt that I knew my place personally, as a father.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was 38 and suddenly felt it was what I was meant to do.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I attempted to work for a local computer place during this time, but that simply didn’t take. I had, for a long time, said that employment may not be for me and certainly, in that situation, I was proven right. I am not, and never have been, a “Yes” man, I would tell people. I needed to reinvent myself and I needed to figure out my place.</p>\n<p>This time put a lot of strain on my marriage to Jessica. She was the main bread winner and while she was appreciative of the fact that I was really good with taking care of Eli and doing things around the house, she felt the pressures of being responsible for the family’s financial well-being. “Just find something &#8211; anything,” she’d say. She wanted me to find something that made me happy. She knew that while I loved being a father, I also felt the pressure to contribute to our stability. I struggled. A lot.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #12</h3>\n<p>During the short time that I worked for the computer company, we moved again. This time, we bought the home of one of the city’s founders. It was on the river and while the place needed work, it was on about 3 acres of land and was a pretty nice place. I had my eye on the house next to it which was a big Victorian (and at one point, part of the same property). It was owned by a couple of empty-nesters and I knew that owning the house we had just purchased would put us in a prime position to buy it when it became available. It was my five year plan.</p>\n<p>Two years later, I was approached by our neighbor. We bought the house and moved in. We still had not been able to sell the first house that we bought and it was sitting empty. We were about to have two empty houses. I had been doing tech work as I could, but still was without a purpose. Fortunately, Jessica was still plugging away. Throughout it all, she was supportive of my desire to find something. I admit, there were those moments where I was just happy to be a dad (that’s my way of saying I might have gotten a little lazy looking for an income).</p>\n<p>In the new house for a bit, I was talking to one of my friends back in California. He was going through some pretty major life changes and was looking for his own purpose. I remember asking him what he’d like to do and he said that he enjoyed going to motorcycle swap meets, buying parts and then selling them on Ebay. And just like that, a business was born. He needed a new start. I needed something to do &#8211; a way to make money. And I knew Ebay and tech really well. It seemed like a match made in heaven.We moved him into the empty first house that we had and ran the business out of that house for a while. We made contacts and started buying larger and larger lots, liquidating them almost as fast as we were getting them. We were starting to make a little bit of money, but we kept turning that money into bigger lots, which meant we needed more storage, which meant it was time to get office space. Our specialty was Harley Davidson parts and it only took a short time for me to go from only knowing that most Harleys had two wheels to being able to identify the part, year and bike it came from; to know its value; and to have an idea on its demand. I became a tougher negotiator and walked away from a deal or two that just didn’t feel right. The biker world was definitely a world I never imagined myself within, but I certainly, for the first time in my professional life, actually felt like I was part of a community.</p>\n<p>Soon after we started that company, though, the company Jessica had been working for shut its doors, literally overnight. She was not making money, in an industry where there was no local demand, and I was trying to grow a company. For those wondering, that is not a sustainable personal financial model. The housing market crashed, and I was spending nights doing database patient record merging at the local hospital.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before we knew it, we were flat broke. We literally lost almost everything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The two empty houses were taken by the banks and we were just fighting to keep the house we were in. It was also about this time that Jessica announced that she was pregnant with Brenna. It was the only good news we had at the time. I was 42 and, for the first time in my adult life, had to actually go to my parents and ask for help. I honestly don’t know where I’d be today if I didn’t have them.</p>\n<p>The company we had was starting to see dwindling sales. When the economy crashes, people suddenly learn to live with that little ding in their gas tank or that other non-critical noise their bike may be making. Ebay started raising their fees and our business model became unsustainable.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #13</h3>\n<p>With money quickly dwindling away in our bank account, I suddenly had this wonderful idea to start making money off of our competitors on Ebay. They had an affiliate program and I needed to figure out a way to leverage that. But how?</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was then that I discovered WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Like many, I had always thought of it as a blogging platform and nothing more. But then I discovered a plugin that would read in a feed from Ebay and worked within WordPress. It took me about an hour to set up a WordPress site and another minute to figure out how to install the plugin. The next two days was spent populating categories, and a little over a month later, I got my first direct deposit from Ebay. This could work. But even more importantly, for the first time, I saw that WordPress could be so much more than a blogging platform.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t much longer before I was starting to develop websites for others. My design skills have always lacked, so to start, it was mostly out of the box themes, but as I got more seasoned, I learned more and more about the power of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we closed down the motorcycle liquidation business.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We tried our hand at running a Renaissance Faire booth (along with touring the country), but that, too, was not really sustainable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I even drove a truck with staging equipment for Fox Sports a couple of times. Anything to pay the bills.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #14</h3>\n<p>During one of my driving trips, I had been talking to Gregg. Turns out he had been doing WordPress development for a while and he was looking for some help. I was not a good designer, and I had barely dipped my feet into being a developer, but Gregg was willing to teach me everything he knew. Every morning, I’d wake up, Gregg and I would get on a call and he’d explain really cool ways to customize WordPress. We’d strip a theme down to the bones and build it up. We’d find frameworks and build them out. We’d bang our heads over CSS (something, I think, neither of us ever really were able to wrap our minds around), and we had work. Lots of work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though financially ruined, Jessica and I were finally starting to see some light.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had finally found something I really liked and she had finally found herself with a position working for another company. We had lost all our homes except the one in which we lived and had depleted all our bank accounts and college funds, yet we were hopeful. We had our two kids, a roof over our heads and work which generated income.</p>\n<p>Most of the work Gregg and I did was working with agencies. We liked it that way. Neither of us really enjoyed pounding pavement, so it was nice to have people who specialized in sales do that part of the lifting. But despite the fact that we were getting busier, we knew that we needed to work on passive income possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #15</h3>\n<p>In 2012, Gregg brought up the idea of me going to WordCamp San Diego. Now, I hate conferences and conventions. This sounded to me about as far from fun as I could get. He offered to pay for the badge if I paid for my plane ticket. Not knowing *really* what a WordCamp was, I figured it was a fair deal. It was only after I spoke with Jessica about going that I realized the cost of the ticket. I tell people that I still feel like I got the better end of the deal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That trip to WordCamp San Diego changed everything for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had always believed that businesses could succeed while also being part of a community that supported and built each other up. For the first time in my adult life, I got to witness it first hand. I had a blast! WordCamp was not a conference, it was a sharing of ideas. It was not a convention, it was a place to build actual relationships. It was a business event, educational event, and social event all in one package. I knew I was in the right place (finally).</p>\n<blockquote><p>44 years old and I finally found my place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But how could I actively participate? Part of being in a community is that desire and need to give back. I was green and hardly knew anything.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #15(a)</h3>\n<p>One of the people I met while in San Diego in 2012 was Stephen Carroll. He had developed this really cool tool called DesktopServer; a tool Gregg and I used almost every day during our development days. Gregg was having an issue with a site we were building and Stephen offered to help us figure it out. I was blown away that someone would give up their time so freely with no interest in remuneration. He just wanted to help. Stephen and I spoke a little bit, but he mostly focused on helping Gregg get through the issue he had. He was kind and generous, and I liked him immediately.</p>\n<h3>Little Thing #16</h3>\n<p>In 2013 Gregg and I were working together on a project and, as often happened, the conversation turned back to what we could do for some passive income. He and I came up with an idea for a theme we wanted to build. It would be unlike anything anyone had seen. Robust, clean code, efficient. In other words, it was a theme that was above our skill levels, over our heads, and somewhat out of reach. We needed a developer with a skill that far exceeded our own. Gregg said it: “We need someone like Stephen.”</p>\n<p>I totally agreed with Gregg and so the call was placed. Gregg was to get in touch with Steve and see if he’d be interested in helping us out. It was a good plan.</p>\n<p>An hour later, Gregg called me back to let me know the result of the conversation. Steve was, indeed, anxious to work with us (if pressed slightly, I think he would tell you that he was anxious to work with Gregg since he only really knew me through Facebook). But what he wanted was for US to help HIM at ServerPress. He wanted to simply code while we handled the rest. I contacted him directly to ask him some questions, set up a path for the company under the new structure and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<hr class="ttfmake-hr" />\n<p>This past June marked three years since we re-formed the company and it’s been a thrill ride to say the least. Since then, we’ve grown the company by over 400%, I’ve had the opportunity to travel the country and speak at several WordCamps (2014 saw me at over 20) and I actually look forward to Mondays every bit as much as I look forward to weekends. ServerPress, LLC is a company that’s respected within the WordPress Community, and it has afforded me the ability to help financially sustain my family.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Jessica, Eli, Brenna, and I moved to Milwaukee where we bought an older home (117 years) with the purpose of restoring it, building it out (and up), and fostering to adopt sibling groups (you can read about it on my blog, <a href="http://twotofive.us">http://twotofive.us</a>).</p>\n<blockquote><p>We currently have six foster kids which puts us at a family of 10.</p></blockquote>\n<p>None of this would have been possible without all the little things, a couple of big things, and WordPress (the most important of which, is its Community).</p>\n<p>While we’re still digging ourselves out of the mess of a few years ago, that light is getting brighter every day.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/16-little-things-grew-into-big-things/">16 Little Things That Grew Into Big Things (My Life in a Bunch of Words)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 12:00:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Marc Benzakein";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WP Mobile Apps: WordPress for Android: Version 5.6";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://apps.wordpress.com/?p=3488";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://apps.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/wordpress-for-android-version-5-6/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3187:"<p>Hello WordPress users! <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android" target="_blank">Version 5.6 of the WordPress for Android app</a> is now available in the Google Play Store.</p>\n<h1 id="related-posts-in-the-reader">Related Posts in the Reader</h1>\n<p><strong>Discover relevant work from the WordPress community.</strong> A section of related posts will now appear just underneath Likes on a post:</p>\n<p><img src="https://cldup.com/uI3GXFyyfOu/WFX8pk.png" alt="Related Post Screenshot" /></p>\n<h1 id="custom-notification-sound">Custom Notification Sound</h1>\n<p><b>You&#8217;ve got activity!</b> With 5.6, you&#8217;ll be able to customize your notification sound:</p>\n<p><img src="https://cldup.com/uI3GXFyyfOu/LBsHX3.png" alt="Custom Notification Sound" /></p>\n<h1 id="invite-users">Invite New Users</h1>\n<p><strong>A cordial invitation.</strong> Invite users to your site from the People management screen, designate their roles, and customize a message to send to them:</p>\n<p><img src="https://cldup.com/uI3GXFyyfOu/9fEtji.png" alt="Invite Users" /></p>\n<h1 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h1>\n<p>Version 5.6 also comes with a few other changes and fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post list: Posts in the middle of being uploaded will be disabled and shown a progress indicator.

The first is that logging in takes users to their profile page instead of the Dashboard. Second, the Dashboard and the link to it are gone.</p>\n<p>I found the removal of the Dashboard creates a jarring experience that&#8217;s different from what users might expect.

The new <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/square/" target="_blank">Square for WooCommerce</a> extension tracks and syncs payments and inventory for products sold via online and offline stores.</p>\n<p>Before agreeing to work with Square on building an integration for WooCommerce inventory management, the Woo team verified customer demand via its ideas board where the feature <a href="http://ideas.woothemes.com/forums/133476-woocommerce/suggestions/3771433-integration-with-square" target="_blank">received more than 900 votes</a>. Prior to today&#8217;s extension release, those who managed stores in online and offline environments had to perform manual updates to ensure accuracy of the current inventory. Manually tracking inventory between stores is a tedious, never-ending task, especially for larger operations. This is why Square integration was the most-requested feature in WooCommerce history.</p>\n<p>After store owners connect a Square account to WooCommerce, they can perform a manual sync from WooCommerce to Square or back the other way. This will sync SKU&#8217;s, categories, details, and images for products that have been set up on either platform.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/square-woocommerce-sync.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/square-woocommerce-sync.png?resize=620%2C345&ssl=1" alt="square-woocommerce-sync" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58063" /></a></p>\n<p>The ability to accept payments with WooCommerce using Square means store owners need only update products once and push changes to either store when ready to sell online or offline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WooCommerce and Square have a close working relationship around this integration, where we&#8217;re working together to on-board new merchants, receive their feedback, and adjust the integration to make sure the initial version is the best it can be,&#8221; said Matt Cohen, product lead for WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>When asked if Automattic gets a percentage of Square&#8217;s fee based on the volume of sales it drives through its payment system, Cohen said that the companies have an agreement in place to promote the extension on WooCommerce.com and in Square&#8217;s catalog. He would not elaborate on the terms of the agreement. However, with WooCommerce powering more than a third of all online stores, it would be surprising if Automattic did not secure a custom volume rate.</p>\n<p>Square customers who want to automatically connect their online and offline stores can find the new <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/square/" target="_blank">Square for WooCommerce</a> extension on WooCommerce.com. Current Square customers can use their existing account details to configure their stores to accept payments with Square and start syncing inventory.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 14:39:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: Automattic Will Continue to Use React.js in Calypso Despite Patent Clause";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=58065";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-will-continue-to-use-react-js-in-calypso-despite-patent-clause";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3234:"<p><a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a> is an application <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">developed by Automattic</a> that is built entirely with JavaScript using the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> libraries. <a href="http://react-etc.net/">React, etc</a>., a site that covers news related to the React library, recently <a href="http://react-etc.net/entry/your-license-to-use-react-js-can-be-revoked-if-you-compete-with-facebook">published an article</a> highlighting how a license to use it in projects can be revoked.</p>\n<p>React contains a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/PATENTS">patent clause</a> that allows Facebook to revoke the license if certain conditions are met. The clause has raised concerns that Automattic could have its license revoked for Calypso if it competes directly with Facebook.</p>\n<p>Not long after the public release of Calypso, Paul D.

Among a number of other reasons, Fernhout suggested that React be replaced with <a href="http://mithril.js.org/">Mithril</a>, an alternative JavaScript library that doesn&#8217;t contain a clause.</p>\n<p>Paul Sieminski, General Legal Counsel for Automattic, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367">responded to the ticket</a> explaining why the company will continue to use React in its products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Automattic looked at the legal issues with Facebook&#8217;s patent license on React,&#8221; Sieminski said. &#8220;The termination provisions of the patent license aren’t ideal, but are not a blocker to using React as part of Calypso.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The termination provisions don’t apply to the right to use the code &#8211; just the license included in the &#8216;PATENTS&#8217; file.

How many WordPress developers are there in the world? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? What about bloggers? Users? Millions of them? Surely even a tiny tiny fraction of that would make for thousands of page views, right?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m writing this on a warm Sunday afternoon in July. HeroPress operates on GMT, so we&#8217;re about 20 hours into the day. Want to know how many page views we&#8217;ve had so far today?</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1171" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Selection_634.png" alt="16" width="178" height="73" /></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s pretty average for a Sunday. Only once in the history of HeroPress have we had a 1000+ page view day. It was very exciting.</p>\n<p>There was a time when the (apparently) low traffic on HeroPress.com bothered me. I even thought about shutting it down a few times. Why bother if so few people read?</p>\n<p>The reason it bothered me is that I was measuring success by numbers. Page views, repeat visitors, even number of concurrent readers on a Wednesday . It was all about the numbers. How many people pull up the site in the browser? That&#8217;s what I wanted.</p>\n<h3>Shifting Perspectives</h3>\n<p>My perspective first started to shift when I went to WordCamp Pune. A young woman came up to me with tears in her eyes, shook my hand, whispered &#8220;Thank you&#8221; and slipped back into the crowd.  I didn&#8217;t see her again, but I&#8217;ll never forget her.</p>\n<p>People introduced themselves and told me their story with shining eyes, full of excitement.</p>\n<p>That trip was a huge boost for my spirits, but I still watched the numbers.</p>\n<h3>Stories That Need To Be Told</h3>\n<p>Typically I seek out HeroPress contributors. People rarely think their own story is interesting, I usually have to show them. In the months that followed Pune however, several people came to me and said &#8220;I have a story, and I really need to share it, can I share it on HeroPress?&#8221; So far I&#8217;ve accepted all of those, so you&#8217;ve read them.</p>\n<p>Their stories burned in their hearts, and they needed other people to know. To know there are people out there who want to help them learn, grow, and have a better life. That there are second, third, and fourth chances.</p>\n<p>Comments from people both on the site and in person let me know that it worked. People find hope in the essays. Not just happy feel-good, but actual hope, that maybe there&#8217;s something better out there for them too.</p>\n<h3>Casting a Wider Net</h3>\n<p>I recently visited WordCamp Europe in Vienna. I was truly surprised by how many people had heard of HeroPress, and even knew my name. Story after story came to me from a dozen different cultures about how HeroPress stories give people confidence to try new things, talk to people outside their culture, or try to use WordPress to make a better life.</p>\n<p>It was humbling to me to hear those individual stories. People whose lives had been been changed by their contact with our community, inspired by HeroPress essays.</p>\n<h3>Defining Success by Different Numbers</h3>\n<p>I still define success by numbers, but it&#8217;s not page views anymore. I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a little about stats, because countries matter to me. A wide net matters to me.</p>\n<p>The numbers I <em>really</em> watch these days are the number of people who tell me HeroPress means something to them. I don&#8217;t keep an actual tally, but as long as I keep hearing from even one person that they&#8217;ve been made better by what&#8217;s on this site I consider it a success.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll ever get huge readership, and at this point I&#8217;m not sure I care. What has HeroPress meant to you? I&#8217;d love to hear in the comments.</p>\n<h3>And You?</h3>\n<p>How do you define success in what you do? Is it number of sales? Number of support tickets answered? Page views?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to suggest that you&#8217;ll be happiest when you define success by the number of lives you touch for the better.  Sure, that might be measured by a stat somewhere, but always remember the real value is in the sparkle in their eyes, and the joy in their hearts.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/defining-success/">Defining Success</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:28:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"HeroPress: How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1147";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35565:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/071916-new-person-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: It''s fair to say that without the support of the WordPress community I wouldn''t be the person I am today - literally." /><div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-left rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20WordPress%20%28literally%29%20turned%20me%20into%20a%20brand%20new%20person&via=heropress&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-twitter-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-fb-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person%2F&title=How+WordPress+%28literally%29+turned+me+into+a+brand+new+person" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-linkedin-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person/&media=http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/071916-new-person-150x150.jpg&description=How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-pinterest-count"></span></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-literally-turned-brand-new-person/" title="How WordPress (literally) turned me into a brand new person"></a></div><h3>In the beginning&#8230;</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a geek. When I was in the third grade, I wanted to grow up to be an Egyptologist (or maybe a Marine Biologist; I changed my mind often). My dad built custom computers for a living, and early on, he taught me how to build and wire a computer from spare components.</p>\n<p>I built my first web page when I was eleven years old; basic HTML, tables for layout, animated GIFs, and all. My first true web site that actually had more than one page was a Star Trek: Voyager fan site. For that site, I learned how to use frames to make a site that looked like a Star Trek computer interface, and I found Javascript snippets that allowed me to change content in one frame when a new page loaded in another frame.</p>\n<p>As I learned more and more about the web, I was hooked. I started learning about PHP, and realized I could make header and footer files, so that I didn&#8217;t have to edit every web page on my site when I added a new page.</p>\n<h3>Discovering WordPress</h3>\n<p>And then, about 12 years ago, I installed WordPress for the first time. Blogging was this brand new thing that lots of other geeks were doing, and so I jumped on the bandwagon. I was 19 years old, living with my mom, working a low-paying job at a book store, and going to school part time. Ya know, basically living the dream.</p>\n<p>WordPress was just about a year old at this point. There were no plugins or themes; you hacked core if you wanted to change the look of your blog. It was like the Wild West.</p>\n<p>And I loved it.</p>\n<p>Really, I enjoyed the process of changing the layout of my blog, editing the &#8220;theme&#8221; to make it look how I wanted. I got more of a kick out of that, than I did actually writing about myself.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years; I left the book store I&#8217;d been working at behind, and started working as a Pharmacy Technician. I loved that job, but it was stressful. I got yelled at by patients when their doctor didn&#8217;t call in their prescription, and somehow it was my fault their copay went up when their insurance changed in the new year.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blogging became sort of a catharsis; a way to vent when I got home about everything that stressed me out during the day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It also helped me find community. I followed and commented on a ton of other pharmacy blogs. The pharmacy blogging community was, and still is, a really tight-knit group. I made friends in the WordPress Forums. I made friends from all over the world and all walks of life.</p>\n<p>In 2009, I moved here to New York, from where I&#8217;d grown up, in the Washington, DC area. I&#8217;d only been to New York a couple of times before; once on a school field trip, and once to see a comedy film at the Staten Island film festival.</p>\n<p>But I needed a change of scenery from the non-stop politics of the DC beltway, and after that trip to New York, I had decided that I wanted to move here.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCamp</h3>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nyc.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1165" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nyc-300x241.jpg" alt="New York City, my home for a little over five years." width="300" height="241" /></a>New York City, my home for a little over five years.\n<p>Fairly soon after I got to New York, I learned that there was going to be this event called &#8220;WordCamp,&#8221; where you could spend two whole days learning about WordPress and meeting other people from the WordPress community. And tickets were only $40, including a t-shirt and lunch on both days!</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;d just moved to New York. I was working in a retail job, and I was renting a room in an apartment in Washington Heights (the upper end of Manhattan).</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were nights I ate popcorn for dinner because I didn&#8217;t get paid until Friday. I was lucky if I had ramen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, as you might imagine, even $40 for something like this was hard to come by.</p>\n<p>And then, I heard that if you volunteered at WordCamp, you could get a free ticket! For anybody  who knows me, it&#8217;ll come as no great shock that I spent most of the weekend volunteering. I&#8217;d only signed up to help with folding t-shirts the night before, and to help with registration on both mornings.</p>\n<p>But I ended up spending most of the event walking from room to room, making sure everything was running on time.</p>\n<p>By the end of Saturday, I was exhausted, but I was hooked.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an introvert; socializing doesn&#8217;t come easy for me. But volunteering at WordCamp gave me a purpose in talking to people. My common interest with other attendees made it easy to strike up conversation.</p>\n<p>After lunch on Sunday, my feet had finally given out, and I&#8217;d collapsed in a chair in our registration area.</p>\n<p>And finally, Sunday afternoon, as WordCamp was ending, and everybody was coming down from the high generated by all of the weekend&#8217;s excitement, I found out that there was going to be another WordCamp in Boston a couple of months later.</p>\n<p>For those two months, I scrimped and saved, begged and borrowed, every penny I could, and just barely managed to come up with enough to take the bus up to Boston for the weekend. I made even more friends, from even more places. They didn&#8217;t need any more volunteers, so I actually spent the weekend attending sessions!</p>\n<p>Over the course of that weekend, I found myself talking with people in the hallways a lot. And I guess I sounded like I knew what I was talking about, because a lot of those conversations involved me giving advice about people&#8217;s sites, what plugin to use to solve a problem, stuff like that.</p>\n<p>And I realized a couple of things:</p>\n<p>A. I knew way more about WordPress than I realized, and</p>\n<p>B. I really loved being able to help people.</p>\n<h3>Wanderlust</h3>\n<p>Over the next couple of years, I went to half a dozen WordCamps, in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, New York again.</p>\n<p>I became hooked on traveling. Every few months, I visited a new city for the first time. I used WordCamp as an excuse to visit my older brothers in Minneapolis. I volunteered or spoke at almost every WordCamp I went to. And I ended up becoming one of the lead organizers for WordCamp NYC in 2012 and 2014.</p>\n<p>By that time, I&#8217;d also moved on from working in a pharmacy to working at the Apple Store. I eventually moved to the Genius Bar, where, even though it wasn&#8217;t WordPress, I got to help people solve tech problems.</p>\n<p>It was a job I enjoyed a lot more, one that payed a decent amount better, and made it easier to travel to far off places&#8211;which at this point, I already knew I couldn&#8217;t get enough of.</p>\n<p><strong>I wanted to travel the world.</strong></p>\n<p>It became an obsession, really. I spent hours online reading stories about people traveling around, working odd jobs here and there to make their way from country to country. And then, I found out, since I was under 30, I was eligible for something called a &#8220;Working Holiday&#8221; visa in Australia. Basically, it lets you move there for up to a year and work to pay your way, with the only caveat being you could only work for the same company for up to 6 months.</p>\n<p>So again, I scrimped and I saved, and planned for over a year. The visa itself cost almost $500, but that was nothing compared to the total cost of picking up roots and moving halfway around the world. It certainly wasn&#8217;t cheap, but I was lucky enough to be in a position in life that allowed me to do it. For that whole year, I didn&#8217;t go out to the movies. I rarely ate out, even at fast food. Foolishly or not, I took some money out of my 401k, so that I&#8217;d have enough money to get me through until I could get set up down under.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And when I had enough money, I bought a one way ticket from New York to Australia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My finger hovered over that &#8220;purchase&#8221; button for what seemed like hours, but was probably just a few minutes. After I clicked, a wave of emotion hit me like a tsunami:</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fruitstand.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1164" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fruitstand-300x225.jpg" alt="I worked at the iconic glass cube on Fifth Avenue in New York (we often called it the Fruit Stand). This was taken on my last morning of work before setting off for the great unknown." width="300" height="225" /></a>I worked at the iconic glass cube on Fifth Avenue in New York (we often called it the Fruit Stand). This was taken on my last morning of work before setting off for the great unknown.\n<p>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m really doing this!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wait, am I really doing this?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, crap, I&#8217;m really doing this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A few months later, I said goodbye to my job at the Apple Store. I&#8217;d worked there for nearly 4 years, and some of my coworkers were my closest friends. My last day was the iPhone 6 launch.</p>\n<p>Apple has a tradition of &#8220;clapping out&#8221; employees on their last day, and at the end of my final shift, I was no exception. My coworkers gathered in the hallway outside the backroom, cheered for me, hugged me&#8211;I was in tears. It really hadn&#8217;t hit me until this moment that I was leaving almost everything and everyone I knew behind.</p>\n<p>I did have a few stops on my way out of the country. I wanted to visit my family in Minnesota one more time before leaving. Also, WordCamp San Francisco, which I&#8217;d been asked to help run volunteers for, was happening a couple of weeks before I was due to leave. So I decided to spend a few weeks in California.</p>\n<h3>The first WordCamp that changed my life</h3>\n<p>Most of the people who ran WordCamp San Francisco worked at Automattic, the company that runs WordPress.com, Jetpack, Akismet, and more. And I&#8217;d been wanting to work for Automattic ever since my very first WordCamp, when I first met people who worked there.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wcsf.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1166" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wcsf-300x227.jpg" alt="I was too busy making sure everything was in place for volunteers at WCSF, but I did manage to take one photo during lunch." width="300" height="227" /></a>I was too busy making sure everything was in place for volunteers at WCSF, but I did manage to take one photo during lunch.\n<p>I arrived in San Francisco about a week before WordCamp, and spent the week working out of Automattic&#8217;s offices there, making sure everything was in place for the weekend. I got to talk to even more Automatticians, and since I was in charge of volunteers for the weekend, I got to boss a lot of them around.</p>\n<p>I had a rare opportunity to spend a lot of time with the people who worked there. An experience made even more rare by the fact that, since pretty much everybody at the company works from home&#8211;wherever that may be&#8211;it&#8217;s not very often that that many employees are in one place.</p>\n<p>By the end of the weekend, more than one of them encouraged me to submit an application to work for Automattic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And I could feel in my bones that it was where I was supposed to be. So that very night, I polished up my resume, and sent it in by email.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the application process takes time&#8211;WordCamp ended, and I had a plane to catch.</p>\n<h3>Out into the great unknown</h3>\n<p>Before I left the US altogether, I visited a few friends in San Diego, and even attended one last WordCamp&#8211;the smallest one to date, with only about 50 attendees&#8211;WordCamp Ventura. It was one last opportunity to see and make friends before leaving a continent behind.</p>\n<p>I boarded a plane at LAX at about 9:00 on a Tuesday night. I should have been exhausted, but I was so excited, I had energy to burn. Sitting there on the tarmac, waiting for takeoff, I reflected on how far I&#8217;d come, and how far I was about to go, and even though I had a 12-hour overnight flight ahead of me, I didn&#8217;t sleep a wink.</p>\n<p>As luck would have it, the best flight deal I could find from the US to Australia had a layover in Fiji, for just under 24 hours. When I booked the flight, I checked, and it turned out making the layover 5 days instead of one only added about $100 to the cost of the flight. I found accommodation at a hostel right on the beach for about $8/night, and that included a free ride to and from the airport.</p>\n<p>I was like &#8220;$150 side trip to Fiji for 5 days? Sign me up!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I got to the hostel about 6:00 in the morning, long before my bed was ready; check-in was normally at 1pm, I was told.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being awake for 36 hours finally had caught up to me, so I collapsed in a hammock outside in the shade, and finally went to sleep.</p></blockquote>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fijitime.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1155" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fijitime-300x225.png" alt="The view from the hammock I slept in while waiting for my bed to be ready." width="300" height="225" /></a>The view from the hammock I slept in while waiting for my bed to be ready.\n<p>They managed to get my bed ready a couple hours early, and so at 11:00, I dragged my feet and my suitcase over to the building I&#8217;d be sleeping in for the next few days, and slept until just after dusk.</p>\n<p>I spent the next few days lounging in hammocks, taking swims in the ocean, and exploring the tiny town of Nandi just outside of the airport. I took day tours, and spent an afternoon relaxing in mud baths, then getting a deep tissue massage that seemed to go on forever. One day, a bunch of people from the hostel took a bus all the way across the island&#8211;about a 2 hour journey&#8211;to watch a Rugby tournament that some of the hostel&#8217;s staff members were playing in. Our team didn&#8217;t win, but it was fun to watch, so we didn&#8217;t care.</p>\n<p>We spent the nights sitting around a fire, singing songs, and drinking Kava&#8211;a somewhat intoxicating drink that tasted like dirt, but made you happy and carefree.</p>\n<p>Those five days seemed like a lifetime, but they did finally end, and I had another plane to catch.</p>\n<h3>Back to reality</h3>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/operahouse.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1157" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/operahouse-300x225.png" alt="When I first laid eyes on the Sydney Opera House, I stood in wonder for what felt like hours. " width="300" height="225" /></a>When I first laid eyes on the Sydney Opera House, I stood in wonder for what felt like hours.\n<p>So, after one last flight, this one, mercifully only about 5 hours, I finally landed in Australia, Sydney to be exact. As corny as it sounds, I&#8217;d fallen in love with the city after watching Finding Nemo.</p>\n<p>I had spent so much time planning the &#8220;getting to Australia,&#8221; part of my journey, that I didn&#8217;t really have any solid plans for what to do after I got there.</p>\n<p>The first order of business was finding a long-term place to stay, and the second was finding a job.</p>\n<p>I had originally planned to transfer to an Apple Store in Sydney. But, as happens in large companies, I got caught in a quagmire of bureaucracy, and didn&#8217;t actually have a job waiting for me when I got to Australia. I met with managers at the store, and they were excited to have me come aboard, but there was a lot of red tape to get through.</p>\n<p>And so a couple of months went by, and my savings were rapidly depleting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For a couple of weeks, just to pay my rent and buy some food, I spent hours every day as a street performer in one of the popular shopping areas in Sydney.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;d gone to the Aussie equivalent of Best Buy, bought an amp and a microphone, and connected it all to my phone playing some Karaoke tracks.</p>\n<p>It was summertime, and just before Christmas, so there were lots of shoppers out and about, and in a giving mood. The Saturday before Christmas, I took in $300 in about 4 hours. It was really fun, and I made a lot of friends in other buskers, and some of our regular fans, but I couldn&#8217;t keep it up forever.</p>\n<h3>Finally, a paycheck&#8230;</h3>\n<p>Just as my savings were about to run out, and it looked like I might have to borrow money to head back to the States, I heard back from Apple. They wanted me to start working at the store in a couple of weeks. On that very same day, I got an email from Automattic. Over the previous few weeks, I&#8217;d interviewed with a hiring manager, and done a small project, and that day, they asked me to start a 6 week trial as a Happiness Engineer.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d gone from having no jobs, singing on the street just so I wouldn&#8217;t be living on the street, to having two full time jobs at the same time, and raking in the dough.</p>\n<p>And so, I would wake up early in the morning, and spend a couple hours answering WordPress support tickets, then walk to the Apple Store and work a full 8 hour shift, and still come home and spend a few more hours working on tickets. I didn&#8217;t take a day off for over a month.</p>\n<p>But, six weeks into my trial, I found out I was going to be passed on to Automattic&#8217;s CEO&#8211; a guy you might have heard of, named Matt Mullenweg&#8211;for the final interview. I had to ping him every day to ask if he was available, and after about a week, we chatted for hours-six long, but engaging hours, about everything from Karaoke, to what books I liked, to my traveling around the world.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And at the end of the chat, Matt offered me the job. I would start full time at Automattic in a couple of weeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And so, I gave my notice at Apple, and to celebrate, in the long weekend I had before starting at Automattic, I took a trip to the Great Barrier Reef.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kangaroo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1156" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kangaroo-300x243.jpg" alt="The kangaroos at the sanctuary were quite friendly! As long as you had food to offer them, anyway." width="300" height="243" /></a>The kangaroos at the sanctuary were quite friendly! As long as you had food to offer them, anyway.\n<p>I had to fly up to Brisbane, then take an all day tour bus to a town hear the coast. We stopped at tourist traps along the way, including a sanctuary for kangaroos, koalas, emus, and more. That evening, we finally got to a small coastal town, with a population of <em>maybe</em> a few hundred.</p>\n<p>The next day, the winds were too high on the seas for us to safely take a boat out. Instead, our tour guide took us to the top of a cliff overlooking the beach that night.</p>\n<p>There were no cities for miles around, and I saw the entirety of the Milky Way in the sky for the first time in my life. That had a profound effect on me; it really hit home just how insignificant we really are in the universe.</p>\n<p>The next day, we took a boat out to the reef, and I got to snorkel for a few hours. I did what Finding Nemo had made me want to do; watch see turtles play and look for &#8220;annemenenennones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And I found Nemo!</p>\n<h3>On my own for the first time&#8230;</h3>\n<p>Once I got back to Sydney, it was time to buckle down, and get to work. I had to buy, then set up my new computer. I went through some more training, settled into a routine, and attended my team&#8217;s weekly chats, which were at midnight, thanks to the time zone difference.</p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t stop me from exploring, though.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outback.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1154" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/outback-300x246.jpg" alt="40,000 feet over the Australian outback, on my way to Bali, it seemed like I was over an alien planet." width="300" height="246" /></a>40,000 feet over the Australian outback, on my way to Bali, it seemed like I was over an alien planet.\n<p>Easter weekend, I took a side trip to Bali, Indonesia; flying there was actually cheaper than most destinations within Australia!</p>\n<p>I traveled inland to a small town near the center of the island named Ubud. And while I was there, I stayed in a treehouse (albeit, a treehouse with wifi and air conditioning).</p>\n<p>Every night, I got a full body oil massage for about $15 USD. I went to a monkey forest reserve, and spent hours playing with the monkeys. One even climbed up on my shoulder to grab a piece of fruit I was offering it.</p>\n<p>A month or so later, I went to a WordCamp in Brisbane. Since I could work from anywhere, I rented an AirBNB for the month there, and had an apartment all to myself, for the first time in my life.</p>\n<h3>A moment in crisis</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how living in a place by yourself is a completely different mentality from sharing one with family or roommates.</p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t know was just how much it would affect me.</p>\n<p>You see, I&#8217;d been struggling with something all my life; something I&#8217;d kept hidden from everybody around me, sometimes even from myself.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I always knew I was different somehow. It wasn&#8217;t until my teenage years that I was able to put a name to it, though.</p>\n<p>All my life, I was told I was a boy, by family, by friends, by society. I believed it, too. After all, if everyone calls you something for long enough, you tend to end up believing it&#8217;s true.</p>\n<p>But, in my heart, I knew I was different. I was really a girl.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d find out later that this was called being transgender.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Looking back, I can see signs that I wasn&#8217;t what everyone thought I was from my earliest memories, but it wasn&#8217;t until puberty hit that everything really started feeling wrong. My body wasn&#8217;t growing the way it was supposed to.</p>\n<p>The teen years are known for being a pressure-filled, anxiety-ridden period in anybody&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>Mine was that way for the same reasons as most teenagers, but also because I had to hide who I really was. At the time, all I knew about trans people was what you saw on Maury and Jerry Springer, and the occasional transphobic jokes in TV shows and movies.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t want to be one of those caricatures, so I buried my feelings deep down into myself, so that eventually, even I believed they weren&#8217;t real.</p>\n<p>But, every once in a while, they&#8217;d resurface. And I&#8217;d bury them back down because I was afraid. I was afraid that roommates would see me for the impostor that I felt like. Or that they&#8217;d be disgusted. I could never let my guard down.</p>\n<p>When I moved into that first apartment of my own, though, a couple of things happened:</p>\n<p>First, I was able to let my guard down. There was nobody around to worry about seeing me.</p>\n<p>More importantly, though, I came across a Facebook post of a former coworker who had transitioned earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>She&#8217;d originally made a big post on Facebook announcing that she was transitioning, but it happened during a time when I wasn&#8217;t really looking at Facebook, and by the time I was looking again, I had missed the post, and she had changed her name and profile image, so that I didn&#8217;t put two and two together.</p>\n<p>But in June, for the first time since transitioning (that I saw anyway), she posted a picture of herself. I practically did that double-take that they show in cartoons: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so, I spent that evening reading back through all of her posts from the last six months. She talked about the feelings she&#8217;d had since she was a kid, and how she came to terms with them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I sat there for hours, until the sun came up. At some point&#8211;I don&#8217;t know when&#8211;I started sobbing. Everything she was saying punched me in the gut like a prize-fighter.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These were the same feelings I&#8217;d suppressed all of these years&#8211;to a tee.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard before that when you&#8217;re transgender, before you can accept yourself and start to transition, two things need to happen:</p>\n<p>First, you need to realize you <strong>can</strong> do it.</p>\n<p>Then, you need to realize that <strong>you</strong> can do it.</p>\n<p>I already knew that it was possible to transition. Back when I worked in the pharmacy, I filled lots of hormone prescriptions for trans women.</p>\n<p>But reading my friend&#8217;s posts helped me realize that transitioning was something I could do. That I needed to do.</p>\n<p>I was in crisis mode. I was half a world away from everyone I knew, my family, my friends.</p>\n<p>I was scared. I wanted to go home, but I still had about four months to go until I came back to the US.</p>\n<h3>Starting a new journey, while already on another one</h3>\n<p>I wanted to go home early. Several times, I&#8217;d gone to booking sites, and held my finger over the purchase button with a different kind of trepidation than I&#8217;d had when I originally bought my ticket to Australia.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d already agreed to speak at a WordCamp in Pune, India in September, so if I went home early, it would mean cancelling that (and letting down one of my coworkers who&#8217;d worked hard to get me invited and approved to go in the first place).</p>\n<p>So, I carried on. I found a therapist that would talk with me online, to help me through all of the anxiety and depression I was going through. By the time we finished a couple of sessions, I was absolutely certain that transitioning was right for me.</p>\n<p>I muddled through the rest of my time abroad. I didn&#8217;t really go out much and explore the cities I had left to visit, though I did some. I&#8217;d started chatting with my friend whose posts had led to my own epiphany. Both she and the therapist I was talking to helped me through the worst of the homesickness.</p>\n<p>I kept working, and eventually, the trip to India came. I had a weekend in Pune, a month in Mumbai, then back home to the US. I enjoyed India a lot. I met a lot of people at WordCamp, who treated me like a rockstar for working at Automattic. And oh yeah, Topher (ya know, the guy who runs this site?) was there, too. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<h3>Finally back home</h3>\n<p>After those final few weeks in India, September 30th finally came, and I was glad to be heading back home to the US. I&#8217;d spent the last few months making plans, and one of them was to tell my family.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/overgreenland.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1162" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/overgreenland-300x225.jpg" alt="The view from the plane over Greenland, as I was finally on my way back home." width="300" height="225" /></a>The view from the plane over Greenland, as I was finally on my way back home.\n<p>After two 9.5 hour flights from Mumbai to Paris, then Paris to Minneapolis, I was home. I wanted to tell my family (who I knew would be supportive) right away.</p>\n<p>But every time I tried, my throat closed up and my eyes started to well up with tears.</p>\n<p>Once I told them, there would be (in my mind, anyway) no going back. It took a few days, but I ended up telling them one at a time&#8211;via text message, so that I could say everything I wanted to say without stumbling.</p>\n<p>Of course, my family accepted me for who I was, like I knew they would. But I still had to tell the rest of the world. So many people at work and in the WordPress community knew me already, so doing it under the radar wasn&#8217;t going to happen. And really, I&#8217;d spent my whole life hiding this part of me, and I didn&#8217;t want to hide anything any longer than I had to.</p>\n<p>So, I made another plan to tell my coworkers, my WordPress friends, then everybody else.</p>\n<h3>The second WordCamp that changed my life</h3>\n<p>As it turned out, WordCamp US was coming up in December, just about a week before my birthday. I thought that would be the perfect opportunity to tell a small group of people, just so they would have my back in case anybody acted like a jerk when I later posted online that I&#8217;d be changing my name.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d already worked with my HR at work to come up with the right language for a blog post on our internal updates blog. And I would later use almost the same text when I posted to Facebook and my blog.</p>\n<p>So WordCamp came, and I pulled over the few people that I wanted to talk to, and started telling people.</p>\n<p>I told that small group of 5 during the community summit before WordCamp. Every single one of them told me they were happy for me, and thanked me for trusting them enough to tell them first.</p>\n<p>And so, that was that. I&#8217;d already scheduled the blog posts (both internal at work and my own blog) and the Facebook post to go out a few days after WordCamp.</p>\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What I didn&#8217;t realize is just how much I&#8217;d missed my friends from the WordPress community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I made new WP friends while traveling in Australia and India, for sure, but most of my friends were in Europe and the US, so WordCamp US was my first opportunity to see most of them.</p>\n<p>I saw people I hadn&#8217;t seen in over a year, sometimes longer, and I didn&#8217;t want to pretend with them anymore. And so, I started pulling them aside, one at a time.</p>\n<p>Every single one of them pretty much had the same three responses:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Congratulations on finally being able to be yourself,&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you need to talk to someone, let me know,&#8221; and</p>\n<p>&#8220;If anybody gives you trouble, I&#8217;ll punch them.&#8221; (Thankfully that one didn&#8217;t become necessary.)</p>\n<p>Every time I told someone, and they reacted that way, I felt happier and happier. By the end of the weekend, when I&#8217;d planned to tell 5 people, I ended up telling several hundred; who knew I had that many WordPress friends?!</p>\n<p>The community I&#8217;d surrounded myself made me feel loved, and I knew what I was doing was right.</p>\n<p>A few days later, the blog and Facebook posts went out, and all of my friends and coworkers who weren&#8217;t at WordCamp finally knew.</p>\n<p>And I felt free.</p>\n<h3>And it&#8217;s all thanks to WordPress</h3>\n<p>Discovering WordPress opened up a whole new world for me. It started me on a whirlwind journey that nobody could&#8217;ve known where it would eventually take me.</p>\n<p>I look back at myself&#8211;when I started using WordPress&#8211;and I&#8217;m amazed. It&#8217;s hard to imagine that I was once that 19 year old kid, with a low paying job, living at home with a single parent, struggling to make ends meet, and just going through the motions of life without really living.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve got an amazing job, friends and family that love me for who I am, and I can finally live my life without pretending to be someone I&#8217;m not.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Twelve years ago, I could never have imagined that I&#8217;d end up working for a company, and part of a community, that was full of so many accepting people. A community that placed a priority on making sure that all were welcome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that without the support of the WordPress community, I wouldn&#8217;t be the person I am today&#8211;literally.</p>\n<p>And to think it&#8217;s all because I started a blog over a decade ago.</p>\n<p><small>All photos in this post were taken by Amy Lane, and are licensed under a <a

be a bit confusing, but bear with me. It all makes sense, I promise.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start somewhere else, though.</p>\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Madalin Milea, and I am a technology professional based out of Rennes, France. I&#8217;m self-employed, a WordPress enthusiast, collaborating with <a href="http://www.codeinwp.com/blog/">CodeinWP</a> (one of the top blogs about WordPress), and a member of the support team at <a href="http://themeisle.com/">ThemeIsle</a>. I also maintain my own blog at <a href="http://madalinm.com/">M.Online</a>, writing about a variety of topics such as blogging, WordPress and programming.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-644" src="http://madalinm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-17-at-5.59.05-PM-1024x580.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-06-17 at 5.59.05 PM" width="810" height="459" /></p>\n<p>But I didn&#8217;t start like that. I studied Management and Economics for three years. It seemed like a sensible option, but while I knew I was gaining some useful skills, I also wanted more. I had a feeling I wasn&#8217;t yet on the right track.</p>\n<p>So I went right back to square one and started out on a new path &#8211; programming; a field that had always had a magical allure for me, something I&#8217;d always dreamed of doing but never thought possible.</p>\n<p>I obviously needed to learn a lot about WordPress, programming, and all things related before I could collaborate with companies like ThemeIsle, or before anyone would even hire me as a freelancer, for that matter.</p>\n<p>So how do you do that? How do you go from studying Economics and being a phone center technician (which I used to do), to a WordPress developer?</p>\n<p>Well, WordPress and programming in general are very interesting fields. First off, the way &#8220;mastering those fields&#8221; works is unheard of when compared to other fields. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you have no way of obtaining the necessary education on your own, through blog posts or whatever. You need to go to school. With programming, you very well <em>can</em> be self-taught, right from the start, all the way to being an expert.</p>\n<p>But maybe this is not the best path to take after all&#8230; Maybe you&#8217;re better off not learning everything all on your own? I mean, I found the amount of info available out there on the web rather overwhelming. There&#8217;s just soooo much stuff. Where does one start?</p>\n<h2>How to begin pursuing a new skill</h2>\n<p>I, for instance, decided to look for some online courses that could help me learn in a more easy-to-grasp way. So, after several hours of searching, I stumbled upon some <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> courses on sale over at <a href="https://deals.creativebloq.com/">Creative Bloq Deals</a>.</p>\n<p>At first, they seemed interesting, but after a few days, I felt quite discouraged. It all seemed too complicated, I thought I&#8217;d never manage to learn anything. For a moment, I worried that I would never become a programmer. But I&#8217;m certainly not the one to give up easily, so I asked around for other ideas.</p>\n<p>One <a href="http://ionutn.com/">friend of mine</a> recommended the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> courses and told me that there&#8217;s two weeks of free trial available (with full access). That seemed fair enough, so I gave it a go.</p>\n<p>Long story short, it turned out to be a brilliant decision, and looking back, perhaps one of the best career decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. After only two weeks, I was already fascinated by the courses and the team running them.</p>\n<p>It was during this time that I found my enthusiasm for WordPress and developed my skills. The Treehouse course structure really made things easy to follow. I was really taken with the whole experience.</p>\n<p>In just one year, I&#8217;ve learned PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This has helped me to grow my new career as a freelancer, and allowed me to feel comfortable with things like creating themes, websites, and even plugins. This gives me a great feeling of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, I could have started with random free info that&#8217;s available on countless websites, but it wouldn&#8217;t have given me a natural step-by-step progression that a structured course does.</p>\n<p>So my message is this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even if you set out to learn a new skill on your own, you don&#8217;t actually need to be on your own the whole time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Get guidance from someone or someplace that really knows what they&#8217;re doing!</p>\n<p>And please don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not saying that Udemy courses aren&#8217;t any good, but in my case, Treehouse has just turned out to be perfect, considering my newbie level. I want to thank the team (especially Zac Gordon and Nick Pettit, my favorite teachers) for their wonderful work.</p>\n<h2>&#8220;Can I make the move?&#8221;</h2>\n<p>You might be at that point when you just can&#8217;t decide what you want to do with your life, or maybe all your previous ideas or your parents&#8217; ideas don&#8217;t seem all that exciting anymore.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s alright.</p>\n<p>You can always pivot. <em>Change</em> really isn&#8217;t as hard as you might think if you&#8217;re motivated and hard working. There&#8217;s nothing that will spur you on more in life than following your dream. Whether you&#8217;d love to be a web developer, write mobile apps, computer games or start your own award winning blog, you can do it.</p>\n<p>There are so many resources out there, some you pay for, but many are free. You can easily find a wealth of knowledge or even just people willing to share their expertise.</p>\n<p>Once you find the right route for you, like I did, you&#8217;ll be full of motivation, and it&#8217;s this motivation that will get you there. The thought of a new career doing what you love will inspire you to put in a couple of hours each evening after work mastering a new skill.</p>\n<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve learned a lot. These days, my areas of expertise include WordPress development, team management, programming and SEO. It&#8217;s my desire to learn more that has always pushed me forward. Every day, I expand my knowledge and hone my skills as a problem solver and effective developer.</p>\n<p>You always have to remember that nothing is easy, but when you overcome obstacles, you get a huge sense of achievement. For me, it&#8217;s so frustrating when I just can&#8217;t understand something. It would be easy to give up and think it&#8217;s simply beyond me, but if you persevere, the sense of achievement when you have that &#8220;A-ha!&#8221; moment is incredible. Just in the last year, I gained a set of skills that seemed pretty much impossible to me before.</p>\n<p>So again, whatever skill you want to master, don&#8217;t set out to do it on your own. Find quality sources of information, and don&#8217;t stop until you stumble upon something that fits.</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your dream career?

I&#8217;m not really on the periphery of anything. WordPress didn&#8217;t really help me overcome any hardship&#8221;. Almost every time I help them realize what an impact WordPress has made on their life, and how it has enabled them.</p>\n<p>It took me quite a while to walk that path myself. I was a web developer for 15 years before I started working with WordPress, and if I hadn&#8217;t found WordPress I&#8217;d still be a web developer, and making a good happy living.</p>\n<p>While WordPress as a technology made my career more pleasant, and certainly easier, the thing that has changed my life, and the life of my family, is unquestionably the WordPress community.</p>\n<h3>Who I Am</h3>\n<p>Another common requirement for writing a HeroPress essay is that you need to write to an audience. Who is this message for? This essay is for people like me. Read on and see if you&#8217;re like me.</p>\n<p>People call me Topher, and for the new folks, I manage this little site. I&#8217;ve often said that everyone is on the periphery of something. I don&#8217;t <em>feel</em> like I&#8217;m on the periphery of anything. I&#8217;m an educated white American man. That right there puts me smack in the middle of most things. But if I had to pick something a little different I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s the way I was brought up.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/topher_homestead.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1104" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/topher_homestead.jpg" alt="Photo of the foundation of a house with a trailer next to it in a clearing in the forest." width="400" height="267" /></a>The shed we started in is in the top right, then we stayed in that trailer for a summer. The largest thing is the foundation of the house.\n<p>In 1979 my parents sold almost everything they had and moved 100 miles north. They bought a little plot of forest in the middle of a very large plot of forest and put up a tent and we moved in. Then we built a little shed, and my dad, my uncle, and I moved into that while mom and my sisters moved back to the city for a few months. We cleared the land and started building a house.</p>\n<p>When it came time to hook up to the electrical grid we were told it would be $20,000 for the hookup. That&#8217;s nearly $70,000 at today&#8217;s rate. My dad simply said no. We didn&#8217;t get connected to the electrical grid for another 15 years.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to read more of that story <a href="https://topher1kenobe.com/category/my-story/">I did a nice long series on my own blog</a>.</p>\n<h3>How I Got Here</h3>\n<p>I taught myself to type in high school because it was way better than writing all that stuff by hand. When I got to college and it came time to write a paper I found that the library had a typewriter I could use.  It was an old IBM Selectric with a little motor that spun and hummed the end entire time.</p>\n<p>One day a guy said to me &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you use The Computer?&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a computer?&#8221; I asked.  He showed me where the IBM 286 with WordPerfect was and I spent about a week learning everything I could about it. Soon I was typing papers for other people at a penny a word. That&#8217;s about $2 a page.</p>\n<p>Then one day someone donated a new computer to the college.  It was a Microsoft Xenix server, with 5 dumb terminals. <em>Five</em> people could use it at the same time! It also had something called &#8220;email&#8221;.  It wasn&#8217;t on any network, so we could only email people in that room. But we loved it. Everyone swapped emails.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple years and I went to a different school which ALSO had a server. This one was a giant VAX/VMS system. The machine was about the size of an old Volkswagen bug. There were terminals all over campus. You could send an electronic message to someone who was almost a mile away! It was amazing, and I was enthralled.</p>\n<p>In my 4th year of college I was told that we could soon be connected to The Internet. I&#8217;d never heard of that, so I started learning. I found out that it would be just like what we had, but we could send emails to other schools! And people all over the world. It was AMAZING.</p>\n<p>To try to keep a long story short(er) I moved through telnet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>, and finally the web.</p>\n<p>One day a friend came to me and said &#8220;Hey, look what I made!&#8221;.  It was a web page. With his own content on it! He said &#8220;It&#8217;s really easy, you should try it!&#8221; I told him no, it looked far too complicated. He said it really wasn&#8217;t, and showed me.</p>\n<p>That afternoon I learned every HTML tag there was. All 40 of them. And I started making web pages. Page after page. I made lists of interesting websites, and connected them all together. I built an unofficial website for my college. I joined the local Freenet, even though I didn&#8217;t have a computer of my own, and started building pages for them, for my city. It became an obsession.</p>\n<p>Eventually I talked the college into paying me to build them a real website. Here&#8217;s a screenshot:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1106" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cornerstone_college_website_lynx.png" alt="Screenshot of Cornerstone College''s web site in Lynx in a terminal window," width="484" height="316" /></p>\n<h3>Leveling Up</h3>\n<p>After college I took a 6 month contract building an intranet website for Kellogg&#8217;s (the cereal people). It was their first internal website, and I had to make sure there was backward compatability for Netscape 1.0. It was still all plain HTML though.  CSS hadn&#8217;t been invented yet.  If there was back-end scripting to be done it was CGI in perl.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 1998 and I was working in my office with some co-workers and one of our designers came into the room. He said &#8220;I have a contract to build a site for a realtor, but I need someone who knows PHP&#8221;. No-one said anything, so I said &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That night I went home and learned PHP.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I built the site and got paid. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s not around anymore.</p>\n<p>I started taking more PHP jobs, getting better and better. A new thing became popular on the web called &#8220;web logging&#8221;, basically keeping a journal on the web.  People soon shortened it to &#8220;blogging&#8221;, which confused all the old people.</p>\n<p>I tried some blog software, but it was crazy hard to set up. One platform even required an Apache module of its own. I decided blogging wasn&#8217;t for me, and probably wouldn&#8217;t be going very far.</p>\n<h3>Enter WordPress</h3>\n<p>In 2003 I was working as a PHP/MySQL developer at a radio station attached to a college (the very same at which I started so long ago). I was teaching a class called <em>Intro To Web Development</em>. I&#8217;d recently heard about WordPress and tried it out. I wasn&#8217;t very impressed. I could build that. I required each student to have a project for the year, and I took one for myself. Build something better than WordPress.</p>\n<p>What I came up with wasn&#8217;t better than WordPress, but it was good enough that I used it as my main blogging software for 10 years. Looking back, I really wish I had become involved in the community then. Where would I be now?</p>\n<h3>Spinning Off Into Chaos</h3>\n<p>In 2010 I had been doing side work non-stop for several years. I did the math and realized that I was wasting a LOT of time and money going to my day job every day. Literally tens of thousands of dollars being lost by going there 5 days a week.</p>\n<p>I quit.</p>\n<p>I went freelance and the work poured in. I took a contract that used WordPress and was pretty impressed by its blogging abilities. It was still a chore to make any other kind of site with it, but I was able to bend it to my will. I loved that WordPress took care of permissions and user management for me. I quickly found out that most of the &#8220;WordPress developers&#8221; out there didn&#8217;t really know PHP. I had a huge advantage.</p>\n<p>I used WordPress occasionally until 3.0 came out.  <strong>Everything changed</strong>.</p>\n<p>Custom Post Types made practically anything possible! It was literally breathtaking. I hadn&#8217;t been so excited since the early days of web development, when a new browser version meant major new web technology.</p>\n<p>Everything in my life began to change rapidly as well. I went from freelancing to being CTO in a startup to being a WordPress VIP developer at a major agency to trying something cool (HeroPress) to writing documentation. 5 different job changes in 6 years. <a href="http://catewerks.com/our-jump-to-freelancing/">It was pretty stressful for my family</a>.</p>\n<p>There was something consistent through most of the last 6 years though.</p>\n<h3>You</h3>\n<p>My first experience with The Community was when I went looking for a Theme Framework.  I found Startbox, by a guy named Brian Richards. I found out he lived only a few miles from my house! He answered SO MANY QUESTIONS. I wouldn&#8217;t be the WordPress developer I am today without him.</p>\n<p>We formed a local WordPress meetup, and one of the first things he said was &#8220;We need a WordCamp&#8221;. What&#8217;s a WordCamp? He told me all about it and said he wanted to pull one together in only 4 months.  I thought he was CRAZY, but sure enough he did it, and <a href="https://2013.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was born.</p>\n<p>I was hooked. I couldn&#8217;t wait until NEXT year when we could have another one!</p>\n<p>Then I learned they happen all over the place! ALL THE TIME!</p>\n<p>My first Away WordCamp was Austin in April 2014, and it felt like it changed everything. I mustered up the courage to approach Siobhan McKeown and ask her about writing docs. 15 minutes later (literally) I had admin rights to work on the Plugin Handbook. I spent the next 6 months finishing it.</p>\n<p>I met Shayda Torabi, Chris Lema, Shawn and Kay Hesketh. I met for the first time my own co-workers at XWP.</p>\n<p>And my father died.</p>\n<p>My sister called on a quiet Sunday morning at sunrise and told me he was gone. My dear brother Luke Carbis cried with me. I&#8217;m crying now as I write this.</p>\n<h3>More of You</h3>\n<p>I was surprised to learn soon after that XWP wanted me to go to WordCamp Miami. I didn&#8217;t expect <em>two</em> WordCamps in one year! I met David Bisset, Karim Marucchi, Joe Hoyle, and dozens of other people who are now solid friends.</p>\n<p>Then another, I found out I was going to WordCamp San Francisco! I met Rocio Valdivia, Julie Kuehl, Dave Rosen, Shane Pearlman, Jake Goldman, and more and more and more.</p>\n<p>It was at that WordCamp that someone nominated me to be XWP&#8217;s WordCamp Outreach person. Dave Rosen looked at me with a sparkle in his eye and asked &#8220;Would you like that?&#8221;. That moment was the true beginning of HeroPress. That&#8217;s where he started thinking &#8220;What if?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>HeroPress</h3>\n<p>Until HeroPress WordPress was a tool to further my career. I&#8217;d made some dear dear friends, but maybe I would have made dear friends without WordPress. Dave Rosen came to me and told me he wanted me to do something great for WordPress. He told me it was my journey to discover. He wanted a business, a new product that would change everything.</p>\n<p>He also sent me a picture.</p>\n<p>It was a narrow alley in India. I don&#8217;t know what city. In the center of the alley was a small child, maybe 3 years old, getting a bath. His or her mother was pouring water to rinse.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to help that child&#8221; Dave said. &#8220;I want to make a world where that child has the ability to make a good healthy living, without having to leave home.&#8221; The child was looking right at the camera.</p>\n<p>Right at me.</p>\n<p>Dave also made available to me a WordPress agency. &#8220;If you need to build anything, use them, I have them on retainer&#8221; he said. They were from Kolkata. I got to know one person there, a young man named Jeet. We spent months together trying to come up with something great to do for WordPress. I learned about his family, and he learned about mine. He got married in that time.</p>\n<p>One day Jeet let go of some frustration. He was trying to get enough work for his agency to stick together.  It was really a group of friends who had been freelancing, and they wanted to make it work as a team. But he couldn&#8217;t get good work.  There was plenty of work for &#8220;cheap labor from India where they work for almost nothing&#8221;.  But that doesn&#8217;t work for actual grown up developers feeding families. He asked <em>me</em> how to get good work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt helpless. I&#8217;d never been to India. I wasn&#8217;t any good at business really. What do I know?</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I set out to find someone who DID know. Someone who&#8217;d made a successful WordPress business in India.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where the core idea of HeroPress started. That&#8217;s why HeroPress essays now need an audience. It&#8217;s about connecting people to each other to share wisdom.</p>\n<p>I lost track of Jeet not long after the <a href="https://wptavern.com/heropress-fails-to-attract-backers-cancels-kickstarter-campaign-ahead-of-deadline">HeroPress Kickstarter</a> failed, and I&#8217;ve been looking for him ever since. If anyone knows where to find Soumyajit Saha, I&#8217;d love to know.</p>\n<h3>Failure</h3>\n<p>The Kickstarter failed. My job situation was uncertain. Jeet never got his advice. The kid in the alley would certainly never get a good job. That&#8217;s ridiculous of course, but I could still see those eyes.</p>\n<p>Then people started saying things like &#8220;HeroPress is such a good idea, please don&#8217;t let it die.&#8221; People who couldn&#8217;t afford to give more than they had, or any at all.  People said &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t afford to give any money, but I have time, if you need anything done, I&#8217;ll do it&#8221;. Dozens of them.</p>\n<p>I started thinking about how I could make it work. If I gave up on video, and went with plain text, how hard could it be? What could it cost besides hosting? I decided to go for it.</p>\n<p>I emailed Dave and asked permission but he didn&#8217;t write back. He was busy on something else at the time. I asked again.  Nothing.</p>\n<p>So I did it anyway.</p>\n<p>I found Rarst and asked him if he&#8217;d do his presentation in text form, and he said yes. We published. It was breathtaking.</p>\n<p>Then I thought &#8220;I should have another, right? Umm&#8230; next week?&#8221; So I tracked down Saurabh Shukla, who had given so much great advice on how to talk to people from other cultures. &#8220;Sure!&#8221; he said. Then I needed another. For about the first 3 months I got contributors merely days, sometimes hours before publish time.</p>\n<p>Failure turned to success. Text is BETTER than video. It&#8217;s cheaper, faster, more accessible.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a viable business. No-one&#8217;s making their living from it. From the viewpoint of the original goal, it has been a failure. From the eyes of everyone who talks to me about it, I can see it&#8217;s a success.</p>\n<h3>Making Family</h3>\n<p>In the spring of 2014 I went with my wife and two children to WordCamp Chicago. We all made new, wonderful friends. My children know people from all over the world, some of them that I don&#8217;t even know, because of WordPress. My wife now has dear friends she talks to all the time because of that WordCamp.</p>\n<p><a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordcamp_dinner.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-1122" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordcamp_dinner-300x169.jpg" alt="Some family being silly at dinner" width="400" height="225" /></a>We were hooked. We decided to go to another WordCamp. Then another. We went to Chicago, Dayton, North Canton, Milwaukee, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Virginia Beach, St. Louis, Kansas City, Columbus, and WordCamp US.</p>\n<p>Without my family I went to Pressnomics and WordCamp Pune.</p>\n<p>At every one of these places we made more friends. More people with whom we still stay in touch and to whom we have become close. Some of them we saw over and over at WordCamps all year, and traded stories of travel and family and life.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The longer we&#8217;re a part of the WordPress community the more I realize we&#8217;re not making friends, we&#8217;re making family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Family from India, Ukraine, England, Argentina, Nepal, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, and literally hundreds of other countries.</p>\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t rescue me from anything. The code shaped my career sure, but what has changed me is you. The lives of myself and my family will forever be better because of you.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/making-family/">Making Family</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:45:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Topher DeRosia";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"HeroPress: WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn’t Know I Was Missing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1088";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://heropress.com/essays/what-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/062916-ididntknowiwasmissing-2-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Banner: The incredible thing about WordPress is the diversity of what you can pursue." /><div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-left rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=WordPress%2C%20Where%20I%20Found%20What%20I%20Didn%27t%20Know%20I%20Was%20Missing&via=heropress&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-twitter-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-fb-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing%2F&title=WordPress%2C+Where+I+Found+What+I+Didn%26%238217%3Bt+Know+I+Was+Missing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-linkedin-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://heropress.com/essays/what-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing/&media=http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/062916-ididntknowiwasmissing-2-150x150.jpg&description=WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn''t Know I Was Missing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-pinterest-count"></span></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="http://heropress.com/essays/what-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing/" title="WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing"></a></div><h3>Backstory</h3>\n<p>My grandparents used to have a photograph that showed me as a child, just old enough to start walking; and in it I was trying to climb onto this little cement horse sculpture they had in their yard.</p>\n<p>For as long as I can recall I&#8217;ve always had an interest in horses, and it was always believed that my primary career path in life would somehow revolve around riding or training horses.</p>\n<p>I had the first chance to work around horses when I was nine, my parents wouldn&#8217;t pay for riding lessons but I was given the green light to volunteer at a handicapped riding facility near our home. So I would go there a few times each week to lead the horses around and assist the riders. I was in heaven.</p>\n<p>After some months of this my parents finally conceded to riding lessons, then buying a horse and things seemed to be on course for a career in horses for me.</p>\n<p>When I was 14 years old, we had moved to our own little property where we could keep our own horses. I would have been entering the 9th grade that fall, but instead I proposed to my parents that I should drop out of school and start a horse business instead; and surprisingly they agreed.</p>\n<p>For the next 6 years, I would spend a significant amount of time learning how to build, maintain and improve my own website for that business; it started with a basic WYSIWYG website builder but I quickly learned I needed to dig directly into the code to achieve what I wanted. I broke things and learned how to fix by poking at them with a stick, possibly the most ineffectual method of learning but this was before Google contained all the answers to all the questions..</p>\n<h3>What about *WordPress*?</h3>\n<p>Bear with me, I&#8217;m getting to that point! It&#8217;s now 2005 and I&#8217;m packing up my truck and horse trailer with a reasonable amount of belongings and one of my horses to drive 2000 miles from southern Wisconsin to the Seattle, Washington area. The next step in my journey will be as working-student for a year, which is just a fancy way of saying I&#8217;ll be doing hard physical labor for gruelingly long hours in exchange for a few hours of one-on-one instruction when the trainer has time.</p>\n<p>I wanted to learn more about Classical Dressage, and with few options in my immediate location, began looking outside the Midwest until I found a small facility in the Pacific NorthWest that was teaching what I wanted to learn.</p>\n<p>So where does WordPress fit in here? From the time I started working at the farm, I had to maintain an online blog and post to it daily. I chose WordPress as my blogging platform, possibly it was a choice of complete chance. But **that was my introduction to WordPress**, the requirement to maintain a simple online blog every day.</p>\n<h3>Momentum</h3>\n<p>Every day, I blogged, and slowly I decided I wanted to do more with my blog. So I began exploring plugins and themes, and then how I could break and fix them to suit my own needs.</p>\n<p>People I knew in the horse community would hire me from time to time to work on their site or build them one, and I was doing this in HTML and CSS until I got started with WordPress; and soon I was converting everyone I could to a WordPress site.</p>\n<h3>Distractions</h3>\n<p>There were a lot of other things going on in my life at this time unrelated to WordPress and websites as I continued to search for what I really wanted to do with my life.</p>\n<p>I returned from Washington and began giving riding lessons in my area. I wrote and published a book about working with horses, &#8220;Centered Self, Centered Horse.&#8221; Despite the outward successes I was having, my career path with training horses was really just reaching its peak before fizzling out.</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/exhibition.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1090 size-medium" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/exhibition-277x300.jpg" alt="Erica Franz, in costume, on a rearing horse" width="277" height="300" /></a>One of the last times I exhibited my horses, this was at a fundraiser for a therapeutic riding facility.\n<p>I began practicing Therapeutic Massage to help bring in additional income, sadly my arms would only hold out for a few years before severe chronic tendonitis forced me to quit altogether.</p>\n<p>The economy in the gutter and I felt this might be a good time for me to pursue higher education, so I went to college for my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.</p>\n<p>School was a welcome distraction as my involvement with the horse community became less satisfying. I felt more at odds every day with the common methods used to train and ride horses until I decided I needed a full break from all-things-horses.</p>\n<p>Even through all of this, I was still plugging away with WordPress, freelancing and slowly gaining more and more clients.</p>\n<h3>The Big (little) Change</h3>\n<p>In 2013, a freelance client I had just started working with wanted to use a very specific WordPress theme &#8211; Marketer&#8217;s Delight.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny when you think back to something small that can completely change the course you&#8217;re on. But it was this tiny thing that I believe began a full-stop to the path I was travelling at that time and helped re-route me to where I am today.</p>\n<p>Marketer&#8217;s Delight, at that time, was a skin for the Thesis framework. So as I was working with it I would pop into the forum support to ask a few questions about whether certain functionality was supported out of the box, and Alex was looking to hire someone to help with forum support.</p>\n<p>On a lark, I sent him an email. I loved working with Marketer&#8217;s Delight and felt I&#8217;d enjoy helping others in the forum as they navigated their way through customizing the theme for their own site.</p>\n<p>And that was it, I joined Kolakube and worked in the support forum for about 3 months.</p>\n<p>After that opportunity I realized some very important things. 1) I love figuring things out and finding out what the cause of a problem is, and 2) I really love helping people.</p>\n<h3>Taking a chance at a random opportunity</h3>\n<p>I had continued to freelance while working in the support forum, but after that time I really wanted to work with another support team again.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t yet actively looking at job openings or submitting resumes to any companies; but opened up Twitter and one of the few people I was following at the time had retweeted a link to a job opening for OptinMonster.</p>\n<p>I worked with creating &#8220;optins&#8221; with OptinMonster on a few of my clients&#8217; sites so was already somewhat familiar with the product and and really enjoyed using it.</p>\n<p>Of course there was some immediate self-doubt about whether I was really qualified for the position because customer support wasn&#8217;t a field I had been pursuing for a long time or had a long history of experience in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ah, the worst that can happen is they actually respond with a &#8216;no&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/resume.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1093" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/resume-213x300.jpg" alt="Erica Franz'' resume, mostly blurred out" width="213" height="300" /></a>Not a resume to be easily forgotten.\n<p>So I got to work putting together a resume to submit that I felt would convey both my personality and highlight my motivation.</p>\n<p>I actually listed the following as a skill-set in my resume:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Owner of unicorns,<br />\nslayer of dragons,<br />\nrider of lightning&#8221;</p>\n<p>Long story short, <strong>I got the job!</strong></p>\n<h3>Time flies when you love what you do</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a year and a half now that I&#8217;ve been working not only with OptinMonster, but also with Soliloquy and Envira Gallery plugins which are part of the same company (AwesomeMotive).</p>\n<p>I work with the really great, diverse team of people, who feel more like family.</p>\n<p>In the short time I&#8217;ve worked at AwesomeMotive, I&#8217;ve learned so much and grown a lot with respect to my knowledge and skills in development even. I gained confidence to begin writing my own plugins and have some published now in the WordPress Plugin Repository.</p>\n<p>This last fall I was promoted to Head of Customer Happiness and have the honor to oversee support for thousands of customers.</p>\n<h3>Reflection</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to look ahead and see clearly where your destination will be.</p>\n<p>If you had asked me 10 years ago what I would be doing today, customer support or a career largely built on WordPress would not have been part of my answer.</p>\n<p>But in all the little paths I&#8217;ve travelled that eventually got me here, what I&#8217;ve always been looking for was a place where I fit.</p>\n<p>Since I first began writing a little daily blog in WordPress, to today working every day with this amazing team of incredibly skilled individuals, has been this comforting feeling that the world is right and my place in it correct.</p>\n<p>The incredible thing about WordPress is the diversity of what you can pursue. WordPress is more than a blog, more than a website or online store.</p>\n<p>WordPress is people coming together, sharing their own unique sets of skills and personalities to make something greater than could be achieved by any one person alone.</p>\n<p>WordPress allows me to learn and grow as a person every day. It challenges me to think about problems from completely different perspectives as I work with individuals from around the world who share with me their experience and thoughts.</p>\n<p>I doubt I would have a similar opportunity without WordPress; and really without each and every person who is using, extending and contributing to it. My gratitude for WordPress is really my gratitude for <strong>you</strong>, the person reading this story about my journey, because we are all helping support each others journey <strong>through</strong> WordPress.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/what-i-didnt-know-i-was-missing/">WordPress, Where I Found What I Didn&#8217;t Know I Was Missing</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:45:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Erica Franz";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: My Road to WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1038";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://heropress.com/essays/my-road-to-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17052:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/roadtowordpress-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Banner: WordPress showed me that everything is possible is you invest enough time and effort." /><div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-left rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: My Road to WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=My%20Road%20to%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-road-to-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-twitter-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: My Road to WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-road-to-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-fb-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-road-to-wordpress%2F&title=My+Road+to+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: My Road to WordPress"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-linkedin-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://heropress.com/essays/my-road-to-wordpress/&media=http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/roadtowordpress-150x150.jpg&description=My Road to WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: My Road to WordPress"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-pinterest-count"></span></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="http://heropress.com/essays/my-road-to-wordpress/" title="My Road to WordPress"></a></div><p>What do you want to do for living? Depending on where you stand in life, this question can either be the most easiest or an incredibly tough one to answer. When you are ten or fifteen this question is exciting and it has the power to open a whole box of wishes and dreams that seem to just be waiting to be realized.</p>\n<p>Well, with 25 and a university degree in civil engineering in my pocket, that was probably the most unpleasant question you could have asked me. This was not like I imagined it to be. The feeling was wrong. Instead of being eager to finally put the acquired knowledge into practice, I somehow felt like I&#8217;ve just spent the last 6 years of my life for nothing. There was zero enthusiasm in picturing me working in civil engineering field&#8230;not now&#8230;not ever.</p>\n<h3>Life is perfect&#8230;well almost <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></h3>\n<p>The year was 2009 and some big events are underway in my life. First, on April 4th I turned 25. OK, that doesn&#8217;t sound like much now, but for me, then, it surely was:). In May I got married to Marko. By the way, he is helping me write this and he won&#8217;t let me write epics about him, but otherwise I certainly would:). In June I finished my studies and in September I officially moved to Germany to live with my husband. Somehow, it still sounds strange when I say &#8220;my husband&#8221;, soo serious <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> .</p>\n<p>When I recall these events now I can see what a great year that was. Still, there was this big question mark hanging above my head; what am I going to do for living? Beside having a major in a field I had no intention of pursuing a career, I now had another barrier&#8230; german language. If you&#8217;ve ever heard German talking you probably know it doesn&#8217;t sound like a piece of cake thing to learn:).</p>\n<p>The first year in Germany I spent learning the language and working some part time jobs in restaurants, hotels and even giving dancing lessons. It was fun, new country, new language, new people. I even applied for a couple of jobs related to civil engineering, but luckily didn&#8217;t get them due to insufficient German knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Why study something you don&#8217;t want to do?</h3>\n<p>I guess this question might have crossed your mind at least once by now. To better describe the whole thing I need to give a bit more insight into my background and life prior to meeting Marko.</p>\n<p>I was born in Kotor, Montenegro that was then a part of Yugoslavia. Kotor is a relaxed small town on the coast and in my memory it imprinted itself as a great place to be a child. Most people that heard of Kotor, probably visited it on board of one of one of the large cruising ships that stop there daily.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the beginning of 90&#8217;s terrible things started to happen all over Yugoslavia, the country started to fall apart and my family decided to move to Croatia that have just announced independence from Yugoslavia. We ended up on the small island Losinj, another tourist destination, where I lived with my parents until I was 18 and was time to go to college.</p>\n<p>Although spending childhood in such beautiful small towns like Kotor and Losinj may seem like living in paradise for many people, there is always another side of the coin. For me that other side were missing options. It was like, there is a way how things work here and you have to get used to it. The sooner you forget about some unconventional ideas about your future the better <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> . And I&#8217;ve had a lot of those. I was interested in playing piano, dancing, design and so on. It was all acceptable as a hobby, but no one really considered those to be a serious occupation option.</p>\n<p>Well, with time, I forgot about many of them as I tried to fit in and as a result I ended up studying civil engineering for the sole reason that it is, among maybe 3-4 other studies, traditionally considered &#8220;a good choice&#8221; in this country.</p>\n<h3>Nothing without a support</h3>\n<p>As people say, &#8220;better ever than never&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t want to know what my life would be like if I&#8217;ve forced myself to follow the path I had in front of me at that time, but I guess forcing yourself to do anything long term is receipt for failure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I figured out that &#8220;a good choice&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean much if you&#8217;re not satisfied with it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is a common saying that there are always alternatives, but sometimes it is really hard to see them. Especially if you live in an environment that doesn&#8217;t want or is afraid to see them. Moving to Germany to live with Marko changed my views and I started to open myself to new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Although Marko originally comes from the same small island my family moved to in the 90&#8217;s, we first met in 2006 when he was already living in Germany. His way of thinking is quite unconventional by Croatian standards and although he also tried to ignore his own urges for some time, he dropped out of &#8220;a good choice&#8221; college just before the finish line and went to Germany to work as a musician.</p>\n<p>He inspired me to rethink my options and supported me from the day one no matter what choice I make. All at once my choice was clear.</p>\n<h3>Let&#8217;s Design</h3>\n<p>I always wanted to do something creative and design was my wish for a long time although I&#8217;ve never done anything even remotely like it. Marko and I sat down, I told him what I&#8217;d want and he was like; great, take your time, start learning and sooner or later it will pay off.</p>\n<p>So, I started browsing all over the net trying to find good sources that I can learn from. First I actually started creating logos, but very soon I was hooked on web design. I started learning HTML/CSS and even enrolled myself in the online based web design course that turned out to be a waste of time as the concepts that they taught were 10 years behind the times. However, persistence does pay off and within a year I was ready to try selling my first template.</p>\n<p>Themeforest was an obvious choice, but the quality was not there yet. When I look at those first templates, they make me laugh, but you have to start somewhere:). Anyway, the templates got better, got accepted and I started to feel comfortable in what I was doing.</p>\n<h3>WordPress all the way</h3>\n<p>The year was 2012, I&#8217;ve had a couple of templates and a couple of small clients behind me, but with all these CMS solutions growing, HTML templates seemed like a dead end. In the meantime Marko and I decided to try to build a business selling only finished templates instead of developing custom websites for clients.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal was to build a business that is independent of the place of living.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The way I got introduced to WordPress wasn&#8217;t very romantic and there is nothing really inspiring in that story. We were looking for a bigger market that could make our plan work and growing sales themes on Themeforest led us to one conclusion&#8230; WordPress.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know anything about it and was quite reluctant to start learning it, but Marko can be quite stubborn:). He was like, &#8220;common it can&#8217;t be that hard&#8221;, although at that time he didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of it what so ever:) However, that kept me going and the more I learned about WordPress the more I liked the whole idea behind it.</p>\n<h3>Community of like minded people</h3>\n<p>From my very first steps with WordPress I was pleasantly surprised how helpful people in the WordPress community can be. Complete strangers were ready to take their precious time and help a beginner learn some basic concepts. This is something I&#8217;ve never experienced before and that is one of the greatest values of being a part of such a community.</p>\n<p>In 2013 we launched our own site <a href="http://www.anarieldesign.com">Anariel Design</a> where we offered our HTML template as well as the first theme or two. Here again complete strangers, that run a very popular site <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/" target="_blank">Codrops</a>, help us promote the site at the very beginning. In the meantime we got to know them in person so they are not strangers anymore :). Thank you Manoela and Pedro!</p>\n<p>2014 was a turning point when, out of the blue, we got an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_arthur" target="_blank"> Philip Arthur Moore</a> ( work for Automattic at the time ) asking if we&#8217;d like to sell our themes on WordPress.com. It was such honor for me to be invited. It was like an ultimate confirmation that I&#8217;m doing something right an that was finally something I actually enjoyed doing. Thank you Philip!</p>\n<h3>When You Least Expect It</h3>\n<p>2013 had its dark side as I was going through a series of panic attacks that seemed to start out of nothing. It was completely confusing as everything was going great in my life and then all of a sudden such a horror. I even ended up in a hospital for 2 days cause I felt as if I was having a heart attack so they kept me to do some tests.</p>\n<p>Marko helped me analyze the situation and I discovered how much baggage I&#8217;ve been carrying around for a long long time. Things I&#8217;ve never talked about. Things I was ashamed or afraid of. Things I should have straighten out a long time ago, but didn&#8217;t. Opening up helped me a lot and it got better with time.</p>\n<p>At the time the panic attacks started happening I got a gift, cute small teddy bear. It may sound funny or strange, but this teddy bear we named Bubi helped me calm down in my worst hours. Especially when Marko wasn&#8217;t at home. In the meantime Bubi became our lucky charm and he&#8217;s now with us where ever we go.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1042" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bubi.png" alt="Small plush teddy bear on a stump wearing a Santa hat" width="895" height="360" /></p>\n<h3>A Glance at the Future</h3>\n<p>The last two years were really a joyride. We achieved our goal of running a business that doesn&#8217;t tide us to a certain location. In 2014 Marko took a long needed break from music to learn WordPress and beside doing the business side of things he became an awesome support agent:).</p>\n<p>We are now working from a home office or from where ever we find ourselves at the moment. We like to attend WordCamps whenever we can and meet new people. There are so many interesting stories as most of these people lead unconventional lives.</p>\n<blockquote><p>No one knows what the future brings and how my life will be in a year or in five years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, WordPress showed me that everything is possible if you invest enough time and effort. It helped me grow confidence in myself and in other people. That is something that no one can take away and that is what I&#8217;m most thankful for.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Thank you note</h3>\n<p>With every project you, me or anyone else ever started there is always someone who knows something you don`t. Someone who can help you out when you get stuck, someone from whom you can always learn something new.<br />\nSo, in this last part i&#8217;d like to thank all the people that helped me on my way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First thanks Topher DeRosia for inviting me to write the essay and go out of my comfort zone <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" /></li>\n<li>special thanks to Marko for all the help &amp; support, without you I wouldn&#8217;t manage all this</li>\n<li>Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/mikelittlezed1" target="_blank">Mike Little</a> and to all that are contributing to WordPress</li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/philip_arthur" target="_blank"> Philip Arthur Moore</a> ( you are my &#8220;hero&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" /> ), <a href="https://twitter.com/sixhours" target="_blank">Caroline Moore</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAKennedy" target="_blank">David A.

I review products, provide WordPress support and handle technical documentations. Here’s my story.</em></p>\n<p>October 27th, 2010 — The day my passion became my paycheck, and I was hopeful and excited about trying out something I always wanted to do i.e. to blog!</p>\n<h2>The Backstory</h2>\n<p>I was always a shy kid. But had a great inclination towards all the creative writing opportunities which were offered in the school. Be it contributing to the <i>school&#8217;s annual magazine</i> or joining the editorial team of the <i>Buzz</i> (the monthly newsletter), I always considered myself an amateur writer. I also remember how anxiously; I used to wait for the weekly edition of the US Magazine and used to pile up all its copies neatly in a big plastic folder bag. (I still have that big bundle stacked in my cupboard. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> )</p>\n<p>Throughout my school, the laser focus on my career was to become a doctor and take up writing as a side profession. Even if I wanted to take writing as a full-time career at that time, my parents would not have allowed it (every parent wants their kids to be an engineer or a doctor — professions with less uncertainty).</p>\n<p>So, I knew that just aiming to become a professional writer would only do more harm than good. Anywho, long story short, I ended up joining the Engineering field mostly because the profession ran in my blood. (Duh&#8230; my dad is an Engineer).</p>\n<p>The general perception is that if you&#8217;re passionate about something, you&#8217;re more willing to take risks. But this wasn&#8217;t true for me. Honestly, I’m not a life-hacking kind of girl. Nor can I pretend to be one who has fully recovered from giving up on her passion. But somewhere in there I still wanted to write (as in professionally).</p>\n<h3>The Hard Truth</h3>\n<p>I was now on track to become an Electrical Engineer, which was not anywhere close to writing, except for that only <i>Communications Skills</i> course which included a few PPT presentations, technical writing and a 20-page report as a semester project. There was nothing creative about it since we were supposed to write like they write a research paper. There was more fuss about syntax than the content itself. It&#8217;s safe to assume that I didn&#8217;t enjoy <i>that</i> kind of writing.</p>\n<h2>Stepping Forward Professionally</h2>\n<p>Five years ago during my 4th semester at the university, I met an amazing team of entrepreneurs led by <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/">Ahmad Awais</a>; it was a small team of passionate developers and bloggers. Better yet, they were looking to add one more resource to their team. I knew this was my chance to be a writer again.</p>\n<p>For me, writing meant putting my voice out there and wanting it to matter even a tiny bit. After a few articles that I contributed, I was offered a part-time job, and I quickly jumped on it. I was like &#8220;Holly Smokes! It&#8217;s getting real&#8221;. I got started by writing on different niches like technology, design, food, fashion, hospitality, the web, etc.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Re-living my passion once again induced new hope and rejuvenated me a lot.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whatever I wrote, came profoundly from my heart and this instinct made me believe I might have a chance to take a stab on writing once again. But writing for technology blogs wasn&#8217;t that simple as I had hoped.</p>\n<h3>Defining Parts of a Copywriter</h3>\n<p>Becoming a professional and sound copywriter is an intimidating struggle because there’s a lot of jargon. Unfortunately, you&#8217;re going to find some new mantra each time you browse this topic. So, I&#8217;m just writing what I found is necessary for one to become one such copywriter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing (of course!)</li>\n<li>Code</li>\n<li>Design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One needs to know at least the basics of these three bullet points listed above. So, that was my goal. Mostly, because I worked with a team of developers and being an engineer, development was not a remote concept either. I knew that having basic design and development skills will only allow me to push beyond the limits of a normal copywriter.</p>\n<h2>A Turning Point!</h2>\n<p>Ahmad had always been a big fan of WordPress, and all three of our blogs were built with WordPress. The CMS was entirely new to me but when I gave it a spin found it surprisingly easy to learn. We had internal workshops about WordPress almost every other week. I made a point to sit through these workshops and even went through project RFP&#8217;s and init meetings. During the next semesters, I had fallen for two things, writing and yes, you guessed it, WordPress.</p>\n<p>Now the biggest challenge for me was to pace things up as quickly as possible so that by the time I graduate, I don&#8217;t end up working in a Grid Station in a remote area. (I mean no offense to the Electrical Engineers out there. But it wasn&#8217;t the thing for me.)</p>\n<p>I started getting a firm grip over WordPress. I kicked off with video tutorials from Lynda and then started reading authentic web resources like <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/">WPBeginner</a>, <a href="http://wptavern.com/">WP Tavern</a>, etc. After toying around with the basic setup and configurations, the next step was to face my biggest fear i.e. coding.</p>\n<p>Did I mention that initially I knew very little of code?</p>\n<h3>Encountering the Gap</h3>\n<p>My first real interaction with the code was via C Programming in the first semester and believe me it was a deeply rooted bizarre.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I found the fact <strong><i>development jobs “are for men”</i></strong> ridiculous and therefore, continued to focus on progressing my career.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was only possible if I would learn how to code.</p>\n<p>I learned HTML5 followed by CSS3 and then jumped to high-level programming languages like PHP and JavaScript. And guess what&#8230; just after six months of coding, things started to make sense. I began with teeny tiny modifications of simple HTML templates and worked through the complex frameworks like Redux and Titan. I think this was because I was more focused on speed than I was on building a solid understanding of what I was doing.</p>\n<h3>It Isn&#8217;t Enough</h3>\n<p>With time, I started noticing an encouraging shift in my life. I knew I was up to something. My next step was to evolve with the local community and hence, I started attending design conferences and workshops. Why design? Because this would fulfill my third component to become a professional copywriter and it let me interact with people around me. Images play a vital role in making your content appealing, and a basic knowledge of Photoshop would be sufficient to achieve my goal.</p>\n<p>My next step eventually hit the brick wall, and I started speaking at workshops too. I assisted the leading speakers at most of the workshops which made me gain experience that proved its worth just some time later.</p>\n<h2>Be The Change</h2>\n<p>By the time I graduated, I was leading the team of bloggers and had expanded my team to about 15 people. Believe me; it feels great to be working on what I want and when I want! Delegating to a team of emerging writers was an achievement itself. Obviously, it’s not an easy thing, but I enjoyed every single bit of it.</p>\n<p>At that time, we thought of starting a new company focused on teaching people all things web. That also meant selling our blogging network. So, we have begun prepping for that and by the end of the year, we had have sold almost 80% of our blogs.</p>\n<h2>The Startup — FinkTanks</h2>\n<p>By now, I&#8217;ve realized that the only person who can get in the way of your career progress is <i>YOU</i>. One has to keep moving forward regardless of what you’re up against. The work you do may not bring drastic and immediate results, but your efforts will not go to waste. And I knew that the career path which I&#8217;ve opted for can directly impact the future of our next generation of women.</p>\n<p>So, it just hit me that I should teach others how I did it, not much of a success story, but at least I could spread the word. Then I came up with the idea of a startup with my team. FinkTanks — as we called it was launched in 2013 and then again in 2014. I searched for my target audience and the perfect fit for this venture were the young girls just like me — fresh graduate looking to learn a few extra skill.</p>\n<h3>When Women Engineer&#8230;</h3>\n<p>I surveyed a little and realized that a number of females were interested in working from home (mostly coz it is easier, flexible and no transportation mess). There could not be a better choice for them other than blogging &amp; copywriting. I mean you don’t have to go for a job you just need to work hard wherever you are. All you need is a laptop and an uninterrupted internet connection which fortunately is available to almost all of us. So this was my biggest inspiration and hence I got started.</p>\n\n<a href="http://heropress.com/essays/making-wordpress-journalist/13436098_10207765500470328_2048167471_n/"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13436098_10207765500470328_2048167471_n-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Small theatre-style classroom filled with women" /></a>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/essays/making-wordpress-journalist/13444387_10207765496750235_2139752860_n/"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13444387_10207765496750235_2139752860_n-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="Small theatre-style classroom filled with women" /></a>\n<a href="http://heropress.com/essays/making-wordpress-journalist/13459626_10207765480509829_61196780_n/"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13459626_10207765480509829_61196780_n-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="4 men and three women holding up award certificates." /></a>\n\n<p>I conducted training sessions on a monthly basis where I taught how to be a blogger and how to be self-employed. I taught all the essential components which a blogger needs to know starting from WordPress to design, code, and of course copywriting.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So far, I&#8217;ve trained more than 700 women from almost every walk of life, and about 80% of them are now earning a living with WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>WordPress is my new gluten</h2>\n<p>All this was only possible because of WordPress. Had I not started early on with this open source script I had never been able to positively affect so many lives. WordPress had started to change my life.</p>\n<p>When I started publishing content with WordPress, I knew little about its technical insights but gradually became aware of it. I started as a 360 writer who could pen down her thoughts on any niche, but soon I realized that<strong><i> instead of doing something of everything, I should learn everything of something</i></strong>. And that everything was WordPress.</p>\n<p>Yes! WordPress is my new gluten and since 2013, this open source script has become a life-changing experience for me. I think that my passion for writing is the best fit to convey my thoughts and opinions on WordPress. Currently, I’m a part of <a href="http://wptie.com/">WPTie</a> and working as the Creative Director.</p>\n<h3>A Competitive Advantage</h3>\n<p>My day to day routine involves reading about WordPress (and boy I read a lot of it), slacking through WP Slack, improving documentation of our products, providing WordPress support and blogging about WordPress. I also try listening to the popular podcasts. I follow folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislema">Chris Lema</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin">Tom McFarlin</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc">Matt Cromwell</a>. Recently, I&#8217;ve also started a new venture with Ahmad Awais, i.e. a blog about stuff that couples well with WordPress <a href="http://wpcouple.com/">WPCouple.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Working at WPTie has been amazing. It has provided me with an excellent opportunity to work with a talented lot of the community ranging from beginners all the way up to professional developers, bloggers, designers, and WordPress core contributors, etc. So, interacting with like-minded people who are heading towards the same career goals as me is fascinating.</p>\n<h2>All Set To Grow as a WordPress Journalist</h2>\n<p>I have turned my life around from being an Electrical Eng. to becoming a WordPress Journalist. By now, I have reviewed several plugins, themes, and frameworks, and now I&#8217;m heading towards a big goal. My team and I are working on a brand new online content agency through which we can offer copywriting services to the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>One of my goals has to never be just a copywriter, and that&#8217;s what I am up to. I write on complex WordPress topics which help me experiment and learn how to develop with WordPress while following the coding standards set by the community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you think my story has a lot of WordPress in it, then you cannot be more right.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I believe that sharing more than 26% of the web; WordPress has empowered many ordinary people.  I also find myself gearing for the same queue. My prime focus will be towards reviewing WordPress products as they are here to stay for sure. Likewise, I&#8217;m also brainstorming about my content agency.</p>\n<p>With that said, I am planning to enter the services market, and one of my huge inspirations and motivations have been <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn">Jennifer Bourn</a>. I truly admire the way she is maintaining a perfect blend of both personal and professional life. Because there always exists a big <strong><i>either</i></strong> for most of the women when it comes to choosing a professional career versus being a traditional housewife. Likewise, I&#8217;m planning to attend WordCamps next year and looking forward to meeting her.</p>\n<p>I’ll conclude by stating the obvious ~ It&#8217;s hard to write about yourself. I don&#8217;t call myself a hero, hell I am no hero. On the contrary I am embarking on a journey to be better at what I do, and I cannot wait to see what is in store for me. Right now I&#8217;m happy and satisfied with what I do, I am surrounded by great people trying to accomplish great things and not many people can say that about their career. That&#8217;s because of WordPress and the community around it. So, Thank You, WordPress!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading! I&#8217;d love to hear back from you.

There I was happily mumbling away about philosophy and life lessons (with regards to our experience at PixelGrade) when he said: “<em>I’d love a message from you to other Romanians about what a business around WordPress can do for them</em>”. I kept on mumbling anyway (it’s a thing I am really good at <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> ). “<em>Sure, I can do that!</em>”</p>\n<p>But when it came to writing my “message”, damn. Talk about brain freeze. Should I write about this or that? Does this really relate to Romanians or it’s just something general? Are Romanians different in this respect? We have good coders here… but boy how lame we are when it comes to… There is talent here but… And on and on it went — procrastination 101.</p>\n<p>I just couldn’t put my finger on it. I needed a solid reason. Something worthwhile. Something that I could get behind as being useful to others (Romanians included) from a new point of view (at least for me).</p>\n<p>But you know what? I am going to mumble away about what I think kept us alive and kicking all these years and what is keeping others from joining the fun. WordPress, with it’s <em>capital_P_dangit()</em>, is an important part of it. Consider it an open letter to the Romanian community (and others in a similar situation), worthy of HeroPress, but most importantly helpful to some of you.</p>\n<h3>Where do I start?</h3>\n<p>You start from yourself. The rest will come later, with time. Right now all you have is you: you the wannabe coder, designer, marketer, what have you.</p>\n<p>Just like me and my brother George. When we’ve started, we were just two kids (he was really a kid in highschool; I was in university — but age doesn’t show on me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> ) wanting to do something NOW. Not tomorrow, not when we finished our formal education, not when the opportunity presented itself to us. NOW! This sense of urgency is important to seed early on and hang on to it.</p>\n<p>We knew some HTML, CSS, coding on my part (but not PHP), and that was pretty much it. No business experience, no mentors, no friends that were already doing this, no internet acquaintances that would give us some work to start from. Just us, a computer and the internet (that is, Romania’s internet speed — lucky us).</p>\n<p>So where to start? From the obvious place, of course. Freelancing marketplaces. After some looking around, we’ve settled for vWorker.com (mainly because it seemed more upper class than the likes of freelancer.com — it got bought by the latter in the meantime). We started with very small gigs and worked our way (in a couple of years) to larger projects.</p>\n<p>This is the point where we were forcibly introduced to WordPress. At first small customizations for themes, then the classic by now PSD-to-WP. We were getting the hang of it and loving it. We were honing our skills, making more money than most around us (it pays to have low living standards), and making a good name for ourselves.</p>\n<p>So stop making excuses and start doing something. Keep at it and good things will happen, with time.</p>\n<h3>But I want to be the Michelangelo of coders…</h3>\n<p>Oh please! I know you want to be the best you can be, that you think learning that extra technique will make you even greater, that exploring that extra framework will widen your possibilities. No it won’t. It will only postpone the day when you actually do something and put it to the test of actual people. I know, it scares the shit out of you. It surely did scare us.</p>\n<p>But that is the only way you will truly learn. You will hone your skills, but more importantly, you will learn what you actually need to know to get something done. That extra framework that you know will only drag you down. When faced with a problem you will have a hard time attacking it because you know so many “wonderful” ways it could be done. You will try to code for the sake of code.</p>\n<p>Trust me. You don’t really want to be Michelangelo (I think neither did he). You want to be happy and satisfied with your end results. This is where WordPress comes into play once again.</p>\n<p>It’s code base is not beautiful by any current standard. It’s not cutting edge, it’s not very “automagical”, part of it is truly out-dated, the templating is cumbersome bordering ancient in today’s landscape. You know it, I know it, and everybody else with some coding experience knows it. So what? Is it stopping you from crafting a sweet design and letting your customers enjoy it? Far from it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stop agonizing about what it can’t do for your coder ego, and focus on what it can do for your life and your customers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Praise the internet gods for having such a low barrier of entry, for the gargantuan community, for the endless snippets of code laying around just ripe for copy-pasting. But above all else, thank each contributor that it hasn’t given up on “the user comes first”. It means your customers will also come first. What a great partner to have when starting out.</p>\n<p>And don’t worry, you will get plenty of opportunities to focus on crafting clever code in your themes and/or plugins. Just not at the scale of Google. But then again, you are not Google. It’s healthy to keep a firm footing in reality.</p>\n<h3>It sounds complicated, and I don’t have the resources</h3>\n<p>Are you committed to this or not? Good! Then stop for a moment and think. Do you have to build everything yourself? Do you have to learn everything? How could you cut some corners without anyone noticing?</p>\n<p>Welcome to the WordPress way (it could very well be the open-source way). The ones before you have literally put millions and millions worth of work on the table (that is dollars, not lei) for anyone to grab and use. You know CSS but not much PHP? Great, grab a starter theme. Or better yet, grab any free theme and hack it to your heart’s desire. And then sell it. Weird right?</p>\n<p>You envision your design with some fancy (aka complicated) functionality? I am sure there is a WordPress plugin out there that does pretty much that. Recommended it, offer styling for it and you are good to go — bootstrapping 101.</p>\n<p>One day, when you will afford it (and if really really makes sense), you can build your own bespoke solutions. But they better be damn good, ‘cuz otherwise few will notice the change.</p>\n<p>When we build a new theme, we purposely try to match the design specs with what is available on WP.org or as a paid add-on to a certain “master” plugin (like WooCommerce). This way we make sure we leave enough time/resources on the table for the things we are really good at: fine tuning the front-end, ensuring a smooth customization experience on the back-end, crafting the copy to help make the complex less so, and so on. Even with 11 strong as we are today, we wouldn’t be able to get at those without leveraging open-source.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the entire WordPress ecosystem is built on a can-do attitude. It’s fun being part of it. Don’t forget to give something back from time to time.</p>\n<h3>The WordPress “stain” will never wash</h3>\n<p>Sadly I still hear about this among developers. And I am sure it can be quite the deterrent for newcomers. I mean you don’t want to hang out with the wrong kind of people right from the start. You’ve got big, long term plans for you life. You could almost envision yourself interviewing for your dream job and being laughed upon for stating WordPress as your experience. It must suck, big time.</p>\n<p>Unless… you realize early on that you simply want to be happy, and that no convoluted line of code will make you happy. Come to think of it, you could create your own dream job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Choose your own team mates. Forge your own values.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Maybe even a huge WordPress logo outside the office (just to spite the non-believers — or that’s what WordCamps are for?).</p>\n<p>The PixelGrade crew is filled with sinners from all walks of life. We bathe daily in less-than-perfect code, we shamelessly copy-paste code from StackOverflow (with proper attribution of course), we kick browser-compatibility’s butt with !importants… I should really stop. We are actually serious people — sort of.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you’ve peeked inside the WordPress world and you truly feel it would hold you back, despite all the advantages, leave right ahead. But don’t avoid it just because of misconceptions. You may be missing out.</p>\n<hr class="ttfmake-hr" />\n<p>I could go on mumbling for a long time (it’s a thing I am really good at :) — remember?). Better leave the rest for another time.</p>\n<p>Now, you Romanian (or less so) WordPress enthusiasts (or less so), do let me know your thoughts about the above.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/really-no-excuse/">You Really Have No Excuse</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:45:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Vlad Olaru";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"HeroPress: How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=1001";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-taught-better-developer/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9239:"<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-left rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20WordPress%20Taught%20Me%20To%20Be%20a%20Better%20Developer&via=heropress&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-taught-better-developer%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-twitter-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-taught-better-developer%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-fb-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwordpress-taught-better-developer%2F&title=How+WordPress+Taught+Me+To+Be+a+Better+Developer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-linkedin-count"></span></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-taught-better-developer/&media=http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ed_heropress_article_banner-150x150.jpg&description=How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer"></a></div><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-count"><div class="rtsocial-horizontal-notch"></div><span class="rtsocial-pinterest-count"></span></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="http://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-taught-better-developer/" title="How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer"></a><input type="hidden" name="rts_id" class="rts_id" value="1001" /><input type="hidden" id="rts_media_nonce" name="rts_media_nonce" value="0de9308744" /><input type="hidden" name="_wp_http_referer" value="/feed/" /></div><p>I might seem like a curious choice to write a post at HeroPress. I haven&#8217;t done any WP dev since around 2.0. I&#8217;ve done some work here and there setting up a couple WP installs since, but it&#8217;s been years since I was on a first-name basis with the code of WP.</p>\n<p>After having written some fairly complex plugins, I was pretty cynical about it. Generally I felt that it was a pretty solid front-end, but the codebase was a mess. It may still be a mess, I dunno. I do remember being super disappointed that WP didn&#8217;t go all-in with PHP5 when it stabilized, like some other CMSes. I also spent a fair bit of time criticizing what I felt were technical shortcomings or the codebase. A quick glance at the current codebase tells me it hasn&#8217;t changed much in it&#8217;s approach, and were I to judge the project just based on it&#8217;s codebase, I&#8217;d say it was… problematic.</p>\n<p>I was at <a href="https://gist.github.com/funkatron/php%7Ctek%202013">php|tek 2013</a>, and <a href="http://tek13.phparch.com/speakers/#nacin">one of the keynotes</a> was by <a href="https://nacin.com/">Andrew Nacin</a>. Andrew knew he was speaking to a room filled with a lot of folks who felt like I did &#8212; that WordPress was somehow an <em>embarassment</em> to PHP because it wasn&#8217;t following current best practices. Some people took this quite personally, and spent a lot of time on Twitter during his keynote expressing disagreement with his assertions.</p>\n<p>I, however, found myself in wholesale agreement with Andrew. From the talk description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Why is [WordPress] so ubiquitous? The answer lies … in a core philosophy that holds the user above all else.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The WordPress lead developers weren&#8217;t stupid, contrary to what so many people thought in that room. They just put the concerns of users over developers.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the project is to <strong>empower users</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose is <em>not</em> to make developers&#8217; lives easier.</p>\n<p>That meant making hard choices about living with legacy code, and being very, very careful about breaking backwards compatibility. Several of Andrew&#8217;s slides showed how utilizing newer PHP libraries or extensions would make it impossible for hundreds of thousands &#8212; sometimes <em>millions</em> &#8212; of WP users to run it on their current hosting provider. API changes due to major code refactors would break popular plugins that users rely on, and likely splinter the WP add-on developer community beyond recognition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fixing&#8221; WordPress would in fact make it useless to many, if not most, of the users.</p>\n<p>Ultimately I believe that this is the correct approach. The purpose of creating software, web or otherwise is to <strong>empower people to do things that they&#8217;d otherwise find more difficult or impossible</strong>.</p>\n<p>Web technologies are building blocks. We use them to build solutions to people&#8217;s problems. The point is not the thing we make, nor is the point how we make it. <strong>The point is to help the user</strong>.</p>\n<p>Have we given them more time to do other things by making a task take less time?</p>\n<p>Have we given them access to information they didn&#8217;t have before?</p>\n<p>Have we empowered them to create something they could not?</p>\n<p>Have we given them a voice they didn&#8217;t possess until now?</p>\n<p>Those are the kinds of questions we have to ask. Anything that we choose to do must be in the service of those questions.</p>\n<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/funkatron/harperreed.com">Harper Reed</a> described technology as <strong>a <em>force multiplier</em></strong>, and I think it&#8217;s important to consider it in that respect. The intent is the matter of the user; <strong>the things we create take the user&#8217;s intent and amplify it</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is key to really being great at what we do &#8212; we empathize with the user, understand their intent, and create something to amplify their intent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes they need a bit of help applying their intent in the most effective ways, but <strong>our technology and technique choices can only serve that intent</strong>. The work I&#8217;ve done in the past few years hasn&#8217;t led me to use WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not a very powerful, very useful tool for many people.</p>\n<p>The philosophy of the project continues to guide my thinking as a developer, a speaker at tech conferences, a school board member, and an advocate for mental wellness. In all of these, I have to find the intent, such as allowing a business owner to communicate more easily to customers, or to help others have satisfying careers, or to educate kids in the most effective way possible, or to help others who struggle with mental illness get the help they need.</p>\n<p>Then I have to find what I am able to do that serves that intent. Sometimes it means making a web-based tool. Sometimes it means practicing my technique to be a better speaker. Sometimes it means writing a letter to a frustrated parent.

With a bit of Yahooing ( googling was not really common or even known back then) I learned about the simplest ui factors of web, CSS and HTML, so thought CSS is the first thing I would like to learn. You know I love colors, colors are attractive after all, specially compared to all the skeleton looking HTML which was never fun enough for me to learn about its font and color attributes.</p>\n<p>CSS and the appetite to learn more got me to this lovely blog of Chris Coyier, namely<a href="http://css-tricks.com"> css-tricks.com</a>. Man you could find a lot in there and most interesting was the videos he did to teach new stuff every week or so. There was this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/1-converting-a-photoshop-mockup-part-1-of-3/">converting photoshop mockup</a> videos and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/25-designing-for-wordpress-part-one/">designing for WordPress</a> videos by him that brought me in touch with WordPress. Promise you won’t laugh and I will reveal a secret; before watching these WordPress templating video I was always mistaking WordPress logo for of that of <a href="http://www.volkswagen.de/de.html">Volkswagen</a>, and was always really confused about the sentences on<a href="http://wordpress.org"> wordpress.org</a> homepage and how they could relate to Volkswagen. Add to this my bad English, yea my English was even worse than what you see now in those days.</p>\n<p>I was already making some little money developing in vb, but the exposure to WordPress brought an even more fun and well in demand skill-to-be to my plate. I was learning more and more about WordPress here and there, getting a few clients to create some kind of online catalogues for them while trying to bring a CMS out of this blogging platform. Back then without all the fancy custom post types and custom taxonomies and all the rest that came with them was not an easy thing to treat WordPress as a CMS.</p>\n<h3>Expanding to the web</h3>\n<p>WordPress was great company for the situation of those days. I was a freshman university student with very little computer science education, almost no money to buy extracurricular courses but very eager to be independent and learn things on my own with the help of not-so-fast internet of those days. jQuery was just around as well and I was making JavaScript more fun and easy. Remember, JavaScript demand of those days was hardly anything other than manipulating the DOM, so the ease and fun of WordPress and the life-saver jQuery was empowering me to get clients and make them happy. Honestly I learned WordPress before even learning PHP, HTML, CSS, a bit of jQuery and some knowledge about WordPress was just enough for me to create websites, mostly in the online-catalogue realm.</p>\n<p>In those days Joomla and Drupal were much more advanced than WordPress since WordPress hadn’t added the more advanced features we have today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So as I was learning more about WordPress, Web, and PHP, WordPress was getting bigger and more advanced.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Perfect timing right? It was small when I had little knowledge but was getting bigger and more advanced while I was educating myself more about WordPress.</p>\n<p>How WordPress makes things easy keeps me using it and developing for it even after  good experience with a couple of other PHP and JavaScript frameworks.  This is why after developing with some other PHP frameworks I was thrilled to receive an email from <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/">WPMUDEV</a> telling me about their job vacancy for WordPress plugin developer, so I applied for this position with them and was lucky enough to get back to work with this lovely and fun tool after a while being away from it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/growing-through-wordpress/">Growing Through WordPress</a> appeared

beanie babies I was hawking mine on eBay. I was always enamored with business and marketing. My family had a successful real estate business and at a young age I knew I wanted to go into business. I realized the importance of online marketing early on with my beanie baby business. Heck, I made two thousand dollars selling beanie babies when I was 13. I was not making that kind of money when I set up booths at collector shows. It’s all about the E-Commerce, baby!</p>\n<h3>Bubble burst</h3>\n<p>When I was 19, I obtained my real estate license. College was never really in my “life” plan. My plan was to work for the family business, in real estate.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for me, I became a real estate agent in 2007. As you recall, the real estate market crashed in 2008 and it crashed hard. This is when I realized I had to change my career path because of the economy. I was heartbroken that I had to start over. Little did I know this was a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<h3>Diversification</h3>\n<p>Fast forward to my college years. -Oh boy!</p>\n<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-988" src="http://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Selection_431.png" alt="Logo for 33.3" width="201" height="100" />With an entrepreneurship spirit, a few of my friends and I joined forces to make the best t-shirt company ever. Our business model was flawless, well at least that’s what we had thought. The name of our company was 33.3 (I know, how cliché). We had a developer, graphic designer and a marketing/sales person.</p>\n<p>While our developer used Dreamweaver, this was the first time I understood the importance of web development. Watching Diggnation and conjuring up our next business scheme, I began to understand more about development, different kinds of files, and the difference between serif and sans serif (everything I now take for granted). The t-shirt business failed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" /> but the lessons it taught me were priceless. This was the first time I knew I had to be a part of the web development process.</p>\n<h3>Back at it again</h3>\n<p>My family stumbled upon some land that was a great investment. It was a “no-brainer” to purchase because the price was too good to pass up. My sister and I decided it was time to learn how the building industry works. Trinity Home Builders emerged where I spent the next four years developing our marketing strategy and web presence.</p>\n<p>After working with three different web developers, I was still not happy with the end result of our website. So, I became obsessed with web development. After the website was in a good place, I was no longer content at Trinity. The CRM and PPC campaigns were on autopilot. Purchasing lumber and dealing with draw sheets was not my forte. I separated myself from Trinity and went back to school to finish the remaining two classes I needed to graduate in Marketing.</p>\n<h3>HTML &amp; CSS 101</h3>\n<p>Last summer I spend two nights a week learning the fundamentals of web development. I obtained a social media certificate after completing that course.</p>\n<p>During the course, we were assigned the task of developing a WordPress website. I finally had my “ah-ha” moment &#8211; now everything I was trying to do for so long made sense.</p>\n<p>Now, just because I can create a site on WordPress, this does not mean I’m a developer. It’s the organic SEO, GA, GSC, social media, and all other inbound marketing that drives me.</p>\n<p>After a combination of my HTML class and WordCamp sessions, WordPress became my CMS of choice and I never looked back.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was fortunate to be able to volunteer the first year I attended WordCamp Milwaukee. It was the beginning of my initiation into the WordCamp community. I met many talented individuals during the sessions, volunteering, snagging swag and at the social events. These individuals were not just acquaintances I met in passing, but they became friends and invaluable resources. It was and continues to be a wonderful experience.</p>\n<p>During last year’s WordCamp at the speaker/sponsor after party, I had the privilege of meeting Topher. I shared my story with him and told him how WordPress had impacted my life for the better. He told me about HeroPress. He asked me if I would be interested in writing an essay about my WordPress journey thus far. And, here I am.</p>\n<p>Currently, I work for Tuna Traffic as a Digital Marketing Technologist, and every day I am learning something new. I’m excited to see where my WordPress journey takes me next!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com/essays/groomed-real-estate-destined-something-else/">Groomed for Real Estate, Destined for Something Else . . .</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:45:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Nicole Osburn";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WPTavern: WordPress to Bump Recommended PHP Version From 5.6 to 7.0 By The Middle of 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=58030";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-bump-recommended-php-version-from-5-6-to-7-0-by-the-middle-of-2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5703:"<p>Over the years, WordPress has been developed so that users and site owners don&#8217;t need to have a lot of technical knowledge to install and maintain it. Andrey Savchenko believes that WordPress is <a href="https://www.rarst.net/wordpress/technical-responsibility/">causing technical irresponsibility</a> due to site owners not having to know technical details like which PHP version their site is running.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Is not knowing good for you as a site owner?</p>\n<p>Few good things ever happened by accident and ignorance.</p>\n<p>Running your own site takes learning and effort.

In the comments of the post, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/10/wordpress-and-php7/#comment-27688">Rahul286 suggests</a> that a warning be displayed that informs users they&#8217;re using an outdated version of PHP.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/10/wordpress-and-php7/#comment-27699">succinctly explains</a> why a notice wouldn&#8217;t do any good.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A notice by itself is massively pointless to show the end user, who likely neither knows nor cares how their hosting service runs.</p>\n<p>However, it might be worth considering trying to detect the host in question, and providing valuable information for that specific host, such as links and other methods the end user can do to update themselves. Many hosts have a choice, somewhere, and if we know that, we can provide guidance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unlike WordPress&#8217; <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wordpress-3-2-browse-happy-or-browse-crappy/">Browse Happy notifications added in WordPress 3.2</a> that notifies users to update their browser, it appears WordPress is unlikely to perform a similar role with PHP versions.</p>\n<p>Jorbin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/10/wordpress-and-php7/#comment-27670">also commented</a> on the article suggesting that developers reach out to their local user groups and inform users why they need to care about which version of PHP their site is using.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One thing everyone can do to help move these numbers is to talk to your local user group about why they need to care about the PHP version they run. Show them how they can upgrade, show them benchmarks of PHP 7 vs. earlier versions (especially vs 5.2).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Three months ago, Jorbin created a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36484">trac ticket</a> with the suggestion that the PHP requirement for WordPress be increased from 5.6 to 7. Although many of the commenters agree with the move, Gary Pendergast <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36484#comment:8">says</a> it&#8217;s best to wait. Dominik Schilling, WordPress 4.6 release lead, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36484#comment:11">agrees</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given that we have until the end of the year before we <em>have</em> to bump it, there&#8217;s no harm in holding off until major plugins are confirmed to work without notices or warnings. Until we can confirm that, I&#8217;m -1 on bumping the version for now.</p>\n<p>This is remembering that we&#8217;re talking about the <em>recommended</em> PHP version. The recommended version should be providing an ideal experience for folks, we shouldn&#8217;t be bumping to a bigger number just because it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>Given the PHP 5.6 support timeline, we&#8217;ll be bumping it by WordPress 4.8 at the latest, so it&#8217;d be nice to use those intervening months to ensure the UX for the wider WordPress ecosystem under PHP 7 is solid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Major plugins like the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36281">WordPress Importer</a> are not yet compatible with PHP 7. Developers are highly encouraged to use the time before PHP 5.6 reaches <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php">end of life</a> to thoroughly test their plugins and themes for PHP 7 compatibility.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/10/wordpress-and-php7/#comment-27668">made it clear</a> that he will not use WordPress&#8217; marketshare to force webhosting companies to upgrade to PHP 7 but rely on established relationships instead. In order to move the needle and get site owners to know and care about PHP versions, it&#8217;s going to take a continuous effort on the part of the WordPress community to educate them.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 00:42:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.8 Will Bump Minimum PHP Requirement to 5.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=57943";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-8-will-bump-minimum-php-requirement-to-5-3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3951:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buddypress-logo-blue.png?resize=839%2C398&ssl=1" alt="buddypress-logo-blue" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30655" /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developers have decided to bump the minimum PHP requirement for version 2.8 of the plugin to 5.3+. The <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/getting-started/php-version-support/" target="_blank">new guidelines for BuddyPress&#8217; PHP version support</a>, authored by Boone Gorges on behalf of the team, states that the plugin will offer full support for <a href="http://php.net/supported-versions.php" target="_blank">all stable versions of PHP officially supported by the PHP project</a> (currently, 5.6.x and 7.0.x). Gorges outlined what &#8220;full support&#8221; means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress should run error-free (ie, without fatal errors or PHP notices) on the PHP version.</li>\n<li>If a new version of BP includes a feature that requires a more recent version of PHP, the feature should be gracefully disabled on earlier PHP versions.</li>\n<li>The PHP version will be included in the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://travis-ci.org/buddypress/BuddyPress/" target="_blank">automated testing build matrix</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The BP leadership team agreed that the project will provide basic support for legacy versions of PHP &#8220;until the cost-benefit ratio for supporting a given version suggests that it should be dropped.&#8221; That is the case with 5.2, which is currently in use on 7.6% of WordPress sites. Gorges acquired additional statistics from WordPress.org that indicate only 3.23% of BuddyPress sites are running on PHP 5.2:</p>\n<p><code>Unknown - 1.08%<br />\n5.2     - 3.23%<br />\n5.3     - 12.92%<br />\n5.4     - 34.44%<br />\n5.5     - 22.38%<br />\n5.6     - 23.02%<br />\n7.0     - 2.92%</code></p>\n<p>Another factor in the team&#8217;s decision is the project&#8217;s recent <a href="https://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-7-development-kicks-off-project-shifts-focus-to-developers-and-site-builders" target="_blank">shift in focus towards developers and site builders</a>, prioritizing building out the BuddyPress REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coupled with these numbers is the recognition that PHP 5.3 introduced features that have a meaningful effect on our ability to write a modern PHP application: namespaces, closures, guaranteed access to SPL, late static binding, and so on,&#8221; Gorges said. &#8220;As BuddyPress aims to build a major new feature – a REST API – it frees us up significantly to be able to take advantage of these and other features unavailable in PHP 5.2.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gorges also explained why BuddyPress isn&#8217;t bumping the minimum version all the way up to 5.6, which is the oldest version for which the PHP project is still issuing security updates. With roughly three quarters of BuddyPress sites running on PHP versions 5.5 or older, a major jump to 5.6 would break the majority of sites using the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For many (most?) people running BuddyPress, updating PHP is emphatically not a simple task,&#8221; Gorges said. &#8220;As such, we would simply lose these users, or cause them to stay on old and unsupported versions of BuddyPress. We support WordPress’ ongoing, progressive efforts to work with webhosts to move sites off of old versions of PHP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These changes will go into effect as of BuddyPress 2.8. In the meantime, contributors are working on <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7195" target="_blank">adding a notice</a> when activating BuddyPress on a site that doesn&#8217;t meet system requirements as well as <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7196" target="_blank">preventing the plugin from being updated</a> when minimum requirements are not met.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:56:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"WPTavern: Stack Overflow Documentation is Now in Beta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=57906";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"https://wptavern.com/stack-overflow-documentation-is-now-in-beta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4516:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stack-overflow.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/stack-overflow.png?resize=1025%2C401&ssl=1" alt="stack-overflow" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57913" /></a></p>\n<p>Building on the success of its Q&amp;A communities, Stack Overflow <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2016/07/introducing-stack-overflow-documentation-beta/" target="_blank">announced</a> that its new <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tour/documentation" target="_blank">Documentation</a> product is now in beta. For the past eight years, the site has rewarded expert advice by floating high quality answers to the top and allowing users to earn reputation points. This formula has turned out to be more successful than traditional forums where it&#8217;s often difficult, if not impossible, to discern the quality of answers provided to questions.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow Documentation is curated by the community and focuses on providing code examples for developers. It offers versioning, collaborative authoring, and voting, which helps surface the best contributions. The documentation segment of the site has a new set of reputation badges and is open to contribution and feedback from anyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Documentation gives a home to a lot of this good content that has been turned away, or very hard to &#8216;get right&#8217; in the Q&amp;A format. Namely, the canonical, general reference, instructional content,&#8221; Stack Overflow developer Kevin Montrose said in the announcement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s need-driven and self-healing,&#8221; Montrose said. &#8220;The best, most diligent technical writer out there still can&#8217;t beat thousands of actual users trying to learn a function or concept while writing real code. They&#8217;ll determine what topics or examples are needed most. And whenever something fails to explain something clearly, they can ask for it to be improved.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">WordPress Stack Exchange</a> is a thriving community and a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress documentation tag</a> is already active on Stack Overflow with 10 topics, 12 topic requests, and 13 proposed. A sampling of topics so far include the Loop, registering custom post types, making network requests with HTTP API, and enqueuing scripts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-documentation-stack-overflow.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/wordpress-documentation-stack-overflow.png?resize=1025%2C696&ssl=1" alt="wordpress-documentation-stack-overflow" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57915" /></a></p>\n<p>It would take many months, if not years, for the Stack Overflow WordPress Documentation to even come close to the quantity of official documentation on WordPress.org, but the site has the potential to become a valuable alternative resource. The fact that anyone can jump in and contribute using an existing Stack Overflow account makes the barrier to entry very low.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my experience with WP docs over years there is a significant issue with people using code snippets over and over again, while they become long outdated,&#8221; said Andrey Savchenko, a longtime WordPress Stack Exchange contributor and moderator.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, my first impression is that Documentation is considerably harder to use than the Q&amp;A sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will take some time to see if it will be easier to contribute to than say Codex and Devhub, as well as if it manages to gather a community of WP experts to consistently participate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, many developers are not fond of writing documentation, especially when it comes to documenting products that are not their own. Stack Overflow&#8217;s Documentation beta will show whether recognition in the form of badges and reputation can attract people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be inclined to contribute to documentation.</p>\n<p>If Stack Overflow can motivate developers to write documentation with the same success as the Q&amp;A sites, the company may potentially <a href="http://disq.us/p/1a8c0kf" target="_blank">explore adding this feature to its Enterprise version</a>, which is built to support private instances of 500 or more users.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:57:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"WPTavern: WPCampus Survey Results Indicate Misconceptions of WordPress Are Slowing its Growth in Higher Education";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://wptavern.com?p=57793&preview_id=57793";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:124:"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-survey-results-indicate-misconceptions-of-wordpress-are-slowing-its-growth-in-higher-education";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3611:"<p>Before the first inaugural <a href="https://wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a> took place last weekend, the organizing team <a href="https://wptavern.com/help-wpcampus-gather-data-on-how-schools-and-campuses-use-wordpress">conducted a survey</a> to learn how WordPress is used in higher education. A total of 486 people responded to the survey. Modern Tribe has not only made the <a href="http://bit.ly/WPCampusStudy">survey results available to the public</a>, they have also published <a href="http://tri.be/blog/wpcampus-survey-wordpress-trends-in-education/">an in-depth</a> review of the data.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of items that stand out to me. Misconceptions that have plagued WordPress for years are affecting people&#8217;s decision to use it.</p>\n<p>For instance, 18% of respondents said scalability is a barrier to being accepted at their school. Meanwhile, 37% of respondents said that WordPress&#8217; reputation of being <em>just a blogging platform</em> hindered its ability to be the platform of choice.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/showcase/">WordPress showcase</a> is filled with sites both large and small that prove WordPress&#8217; scalability. It&#8217;s also filled with sites that show WordPress is used for far more than blogging.</p>\n<p>As WordPress continues to evolve from being a blogging platform to something capable of doing much more, it&#8217;s disappointing that this misconception still exists. Is there any hope that people can discover and realize that blogging is something WordPress is great at, but at its core, provides people the ability to go above and beyond?</p>\n<p>Another fascinating part of the survey is the security aspect where 42% of respondents reported that they do not have a list of vetted plugins for their network. In addition, 13% of respondents said their networks are not running the latest version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>How survey questions are asked can be the difference between receiving actionable or unusable data. ModernTribe acknowledges that the questions in future versions of the survey can be worded better to increase the accuracy of data.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you take a look at the multi-part question we used to help qualify the institutions represented in the survey, you’ll that it could have been written much better. Since the main part of the question was mandatory, the survey also made the subsection where you could input your URL mandatory as well.</p>\n<p>Other areas we can improve include better categorization for multiple-choice questions, including an option for &#8216;n/a&#8217; or &#8216;I don’t know&#8217; in more questions, and fewer write-in responses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing the survey results, you can access them via <a href="http://bit.ly/WPCampusStudy">this spreadsheet</a> on Google Docs.</p>\n<p>For those that didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend WPCampus in person or watch it live, I highly encourage you to read <a href="http://davidbisset.com/wpcampus-review/">this review</a> from David Bisset, who has organized a number of large WordPress conferences.

This new document in the foundation&#8217;s library, written by Nadia Eghbal, addresses the challenges of sustaining our digital infrastructure:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Everybody relies on shared code to write software, including Fortune 500 companies, government, major software companies and startups. In a world driven by technology, we are putting increased demand on those who maintain our digital infrastructure. Yet because these communities are not highly visible, the rest of the world has been slow to notice.</p>\n<p>Just like physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure needs regular upkeep and maintenance. But financial support for digital infrastructure is much harder to come by.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eghbal, an amateur software developer who previously worked in venture capital, drew from her experience using open source code when preparing the 143-page report. She also interviewed many leaders and contributors in various open source software communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After I left my job in venture capital last year, I set off to explore the paradox I couldn’t stop thinking about: that there were valuable software tools that couldn’t be supported by commercial models, and that they lacked any form of institutional support,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The unique thing about this extraordinary contribution from the Ford Foundation is that Eghbal wrote the document to help consumers and companies understand the toll open source software takes on its contributors and offers strategies for how they can be supportive of the world&#8217;s shared digital infrastructure. It bridges a critical gap in understanding between the open source software development community and the people who use the software every day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of us take opening a software application for granted, the way we take turning on the lights for granted,&#8221; Eghbal said. &#8220;We don’t think about the human capital necessary to make that happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Eghbal compares the physical infrastructure of the transportation industry to that of the digital world. She contends that the decentralized nature of digital infrastructure makes it more difficult to maintain as a public good. Since the progress is driven by citizens working together, and not by any official governing body, it requires consumers and companies to be supportive of how software communities work if we hope to achieve long-term sustainability of the open source projects we depend on.</p>\n<p>Eghbal introduces consumers to common ways that open source projects find financial support but also highlights how many widely used projects can fall through the cracks. The document opens with the example of OpenSSL and the Heartbleed vulnerability which was exposed in 2014.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A 2015 study by the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil looked at 133 of the most actively used projects hosted on GitHub, across programming languages, and found that 64%, or nearly two-thirds, relied upon just one or two developers to survive,&#8221; Eghbal said. &#8220;Although there may be a long tail of casual or infrequent contributors, for many projects, the major responsibilities of project management fall on just a few people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In offering a brief history of open source software, Eghbal cites WordPress as a prime example (on page 34) of software that is flexible to customize thanks to the freedom its creators gave the project when licensing it under the GPL. Nevertheless, our community shares many of the struggles identified in the document, as maintainers of some of our most important development tools often cannot find financial support that will enable them to keep working on these projects.</p>\n<p>The white paper covers many important topics that help non-technical consumers understand the critical need to support the creators of our digital infrastructure. A few example chapters include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How not charging for software transformed society</li>\n<li>Why digital infrastructure support problems are accelerating</li>\n<li>Open source’s complicated relationship with money</li>\n<li>Business models for digital infrastructure</li>\n<li>Institutional efforts to support digital infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eghbal advocates treating digital infrastructure as a necessary public good and working with existing software communities. She calls for a more holistic approach to project support, beyond just code and money.</p>\n<p>Many of the topics in this white paper are completely new ideas for software consumers but Eghbal&#8217;s explanations make them easy for anyone to understand. She includes basic explanations for software terms like frameworks, libraries, and languages, and explains why certain types of open source projects have a more difficult time finding a means of financial support.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading this document, whether you are an open source project maintainer, a company decision maker who contracts software development, or a consumer. The white paper doesn&#8217;t just explore the challenges but also offers constructive ways that people of all walks of life can work together to support our digital infrastructure.

According to an email forwarded to the Tavern from a WP Engine customer, Linode&#8217;s <a href="https://status.linode.com/incidents/dgzvdyqttr9f">legacy Xen host servers</a> contain a critical security vulnerability.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are contacting you today regarding an upcoming emergency security maintenance being performed at one of our cloud infrastructure providers.

The community program hosts meetups and workshops on the weekend where anyone from &#8220;enthusiastic beginners to the 1337est hackers&#8221; is welcome to share findings and demonstrate skills and exploits.</p>\n<p>The goal of the community event is to contribute to the security of widely used open source software projects and participants are strongly encouraged to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to the authors of the original code. WordPress and its thousands of plugins are the target for this month, which organizers call &#8220;a bug hunter&#8217;s paradise.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Summer of Pwnage <a href="https://sumofpwn.nl/advisories.html" target="_blank">July 2016 findings</a> includes dozens of vulnerabilities discovered in popular WordPress plugins. So far, 18 vulnerabilities have been fixed by the plugin authors and more than 40 others are currently in the reporting stage.</p>\n<p>This week Ninja Forms, which has more than 600,000 active installs, issued <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/changelog/" target="_blank">a security release</a> that fixed multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities discovered by Summer of Pwnage participants. The bug hunters also discovered a XSS vulnerability in WooCommerce (active on over a million installs), which was subsequently <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/woocommerce-2-6-3-fixsecurity-release-notes/" target="_blank">patched</a>.</p>\n<p>Security updates are also available for other popular plugins as the result of the program&#8217;s efforts, including Paid Memberships Pro, WP Fastest Cache, Easy Forms for MailChimp, and others. The list of reported vulnerabilities includes links to describe each and is being updated frequently, as WordPress plugin authors release patches to their plugins.</p>\n<p>Summer of Pwnage is hosted at <a href="https://www.securify.nl/" target="_blank">Securify</a>, a software security company. Organizers provide users with VMs and set them loose hunting bugs. The focus of the event is sharing knowledge and teaching others and has been highly beneficial to the WordPress community so far.</p>\n<p>With WordPress plugin vulnerabilities so plentiful, even within the top professionally supported plugins, it would be great to see a niche conference or virtual event focused on security with a contributor day. WordPress needs more guardians spread across the community that can specialize in contributing back in this way. Educational events like Summer of Pwnage demonstrate how successful this kind of event can be for hunting down serious vulnerabilities in the software that millions of people use every day.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 21:38:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Human Made is Giving Away Two Full Scholarships to A Week of REST Conference";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=57650";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"https://wptavern.com/human-made-is-giving-away-two-full-scholarships-to-a-week-of-rest-conference";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1349:"<p><a href="https://aweekofrest.hm/">A Week of REST</a>, a four-day conference devoted to the WordPress REST API that takes place September 4-9 in Darwin Lake, Matlock in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://hmn.md/2016/07/20/announcing-two-full-scholarships-a-week-of-rest-for-students-and-under-represented-groups-in-the-tech-industry/">has announced</a> it is offering two full scholarships for students and under-represented groups in the tech industry.</p>\n<p>“The WordPress REST API is transforming how people use WordPress, opening it up to new technologies and communities.

The tool captures the details required to configure the database, site info, admin user, and password. It outputs one long command that WP-CLI users can copy and paste.</p>\n<p>At first it might seem counterintuitive &#8211; if you use the command line to manage WordPress, why would you want to add an extra interface to your workflow? Brugman explained the problem that led him to create WP-CLI GUI:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I heard about WP-CLI and gave it a shot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought it was very neat for managing your sites but a bit of a hassle for new installs. Because installing WP with the CLI is a sequence of commands, if you don&#8217;t concatenate them, you have wait for each to end.

A tweetstorm is a series of tweets linked together in chronological order around a particular topic.</p>\n<p>There are a number of useful nuggets of wisdom in his tweets that I think can benefit from more exposure to a wider segment of the WordPress community outside of Twitter. It&#8217;s a snapshot of one individual&#8217;s eight year plus journey in trying to create a sustainable business using WordPress. With Jacoby&#8217;s permission, I&#8217;ve republished his tweetstorm into a blog post to make it easier to read and digest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>No exacting leadership hierarchy provides the perception of opportunity for anyone to step-up. This is actually really important. Having<a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt"> @photomatt</a> (Matt Mullenweg) be the BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) means we always have a safety net, to help the community be true-north during times of unrest.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that<a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt"> @photomatt</a> purposely has made monumental gestures to remove himself and<a href="https://twitter.com/automattic"> @automattic</a> as a WordPress dependency. It&#8217;s up to the 99% of us that aren&#8217;t<a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt"> @photomatt</a> to learn from what he&#8217;s accomplished, and find the ways to invest that he hasn&#8217;t yet.</p>\n<p>Core, Plugins, Themes, etc… none of this in WordPress is easy or directly profitable. It&#8217;s all a very long gamble to sustainability. Some WordPress companies/agencies have long-term investment strategies outside of employee retention/satisfaction. Again, it&#8217;s a long game.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, WordPress needs more than<a href="https://twitter.com/automattic"> @Automattic</a>&#8216;s bank-roll to help empower the next generation of awesome plugins/themes as products. Some people in the WordPress community that have labeled me: Hot-Lava: Do Not Touch – that makes me sad, because I don&#8217;t feel that way.</p>\n<p>People will choose to stonewall professional progress because of misperception. Biases exist all around the WordPress community. Some of the most prolific contributors to WordPress (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexkingorg">@alexkingorg</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/koop"> @koop</a>, etc…) ultimately were shunned and exiled. It can be toxic.</p>\n<p>When<a href="https://twitter.com/johnbillion"> @johnbillion</a> (John Blackbourn) says there&#8217;s a lack of leadership – there is plenty of leadership, it&#8217;s all just currently in a holding pattern. Holding patterns are not bad things, they are necessary to assess what happens next. And there is more happening than ever before.</p>\n<p>WordPress is about to get real. Reporting will shape your perception of progress, because there is too much progress to report on. <a href="https://twitter.com/post_status">@post_status</a> &amp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wptavern"> @wptavern</a> are our CNN and BBC. They are plugged in so the rest of us do not have to be, and can worry about other things.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve made a lot of friends and allies through WordPress, and accidentally made foes somehow too. That&#8217;s not fair. We all need each other. So many individuals are pouring their lives into passion projects surrounding WordPress, hoping to eventually pay their kids tuition.</p>\n<p>Talented individuals wanting a better life for their families than they had, busting their butts 24/7 on great ideas, need our support. When someone says <em>this plugin sucks because whatever</em> – it&#8217;s an OPPORTUNITY to help someone. Take it, be helpful, that&#8217;s the spirit.</p>\n<p>When someone says <em>this WordCamp talk was bad</em> – provide that person with feedback yourself, in private, and help elevate them. The problems of the relatively small WordPress community are systemic across all communities. Be ready to be wrong, learn, and recover.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wanted to take a vow of poverty, relinquish my earthly possessions, and accept WordPress as my CMS and savior. I do want to be profitable enough (thanks to my WordPress experience) to provide others with stable and comfortable living conditions.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m eight solid years in, with a thorough understanding of the entire WordPress landscape, and know there are good people struggling. There&#8217;s no reason for qualified professionals to struggle in the WordPress space anymore. There is LIMITLESS opportunity and ability.</p>\n<p>I deeply want WordPress to continue down the trajectory of success, and I want everyone following me to succeed along with it. Angel rounds dramatically increase the odds of success. Companies like<a href="https://twitter.com/10up"> @10up</a> (the bootstrapped anomalies) need a<a href="https://twitter.com/jakemgold"> @jakemgold</a> (Jake Goldman) to work.</p>\n<p>People are VERY quick to categorize. Yes; I&#8217;m an engineer. I also love philosophy, business, yo-yo&#8217;s, and clearly tweet-storms. The next time someone says something negative about someone/thing WordPress related, please remind them super-villains are not real.</p>\n<p>To make money in WordPress, you need to be likable, and build products where your likability shines through. Like<a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins"> @pippinsplugins</a> (Pippin Williamson). Being likable and profitable in open-source means having integrity, focusing on people more than product, and hoping it pays off in the end.</p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m likable, and I&#8217;d always like to be more likable, but I also know tweet-storms like this make people think you&#8217;re crazy. If you think there is ANYTHING I can do personally or professionally to help you, please know that I desperately want to.</p>\n<p>I used to know<a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt"> @photomatt</a> very well. He&#8217;s not a bad guy; he&#8217;s a great guy. Also an easy target. Concentrate on you. Shout-out to my starving indie plugin and theme artists out there. You rule. Don&#8217;t give up. We&#8217;ll figure it out together. Thanks for listening; sorry to muck-up your day. WordPress rules because of all of you.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 21:49:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: Easily Add, Remove, and Rearrange Columns With The Admin Columns Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"https://wptavern.com?p=57565&preview_id=57565";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"https://wptavern.com/easily-add-remove-and-rearrange-columns-with-the-admin-columns-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2834:"<p>If you find yourself wanting more control over the columns on the posts, post types, pages, media, comments, links, and users administration screens, take a look at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/">Admin Columns</a> plugin.

If you maintain a number of sites that uses Admin Columns, the ability to import and export column configurations can be a huge time saver.</p>\n<p>I thoroughly tested <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/codepress/">Admin Columns</a> on WordPress 4.6 beta 3 and didn&#8217;t encounter any issues.

I also greatly enjoyed <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/06/25/matt-mullenweg-interview-and-qa/">interviewing Matt Mullenweg</a> for the event keynote.</p>\n<p>I really recommend you check out all of the talks and choose those which you may learn from.

Each event has been assigned a deputy who will meet bi-weekly with the local team to mentor the new WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>Andrea Middleton outlined in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/05/25/wordcamp-incubator-locations-announcement/" target="_blank">announcement</a> how the team plans to proceed with getting these events off the ground.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Denpasar, Harare, and Medellín will work with their respective deputies to start a monthly WordPress meetup group or add their existing meetup group to the chapter account program,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;Once the local WordPress user group is meeting regularly, each team will work on finding a venue, setting a date, recruiting speakers, and spreading the word about the upcoming WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to take the pressure off the new organizers, the Community team will assist them in scheduling and finding speakers. The events will be 100% funded by the global sponsorship grant so organizers can focus on community building without the pressure of fundraising. Middleton said they are aiming for no more than three non-local speakers at each event, which she anticipates will happen in the last quarter of 2016.</p>\n<p>The challenge with the Incubator program is to ensure these events are a launching point and not just a flash in the pan. Middleton and the community team deputies are working to establish these emerging communities so that they continue to grow organically after the events conclude.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for these events is to organize an easily reproducible, one-day, one-track event with about 50-75 attendees,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;Hopefully by the end of the organizing/incubating experience, members of the local community will feel confident that they can organize an annual WordCamp independently in the years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 31 May 2016 05:12:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 15:12:54 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"420743";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 15:00:17 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911080210";}', 'no');

(265, 58, 'transcript', '<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">Tweet this quote</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

(443, 92, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I''m fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We''re trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It''s with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it''s just aarron ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... and my website is <a href=" aarronwalter.com">aarronwalter.com</a>, so ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, thank you!\r\n</dd>'),

(551, 104, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall. Anytime.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

(569, 106, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHey Richard.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nHi.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou guys just did an amazing thing today, you open sourced your apprenticeship, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe did, we took the leap and we done the thing that we should have done a long time ago, and that''s made it public.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat is so awesome, can you just talk about everything you can about that. What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We''ve done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we''ve been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we''ve gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we''ve got better ideas." Or, "We''ve got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe had been doing internships and we''d been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it''s a fairly new idea. When I got back, I''d asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let''s just try it, let''s just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Now you had mentioned there''s a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you''d kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let''s go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don''t know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What''s the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it''s something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what''s coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let''s say you''re a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that''s like, or in some cases if you''re in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you''re taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you''re creating.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason why it''s different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let''s have this person here for a short amount of time while they''re doing this thing." It''s almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you''re putting you''re time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThe selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we''ve been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they''re trying to get out of the program. We''ll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we''ll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they''re going to work on things that we challenge them with. We''re going to provide them with a product, we''re going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe''re going to assess them across different criteria. We''re going to look at their actual work, so if they''re designers we''re going to look at their design skills. If they''re developers we''re going to look at that. If they''re a combination we''re going to look at both. What we''re also secretly doing is we''re seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it''s like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We''re looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we''ll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we''ve got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they''ll go through that, the 15 week program.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It sounds like you''re looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you''re looking for cues that they''re going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThey''re the same. We''re looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we''re definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We''re looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can''t necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture''s different that, but that''s something that we have no control over.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don''t?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we''re in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We''re actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we''re starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We''re like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn''t have let all of them go and find other jobs." We''re pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They''re part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that''s one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nIn the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn''t it work for apprenticeships too.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. They''ve gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who''s who, it''s amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that''s a pretty strong group of people\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, that''s amazing. What kind of person doesn''t make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you''re like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who''s designing a digital product. We''re looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they''re unable to communicate it effectively, or they''re unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don''t work well in teams and they don''t collaborate well. Those are the things that we''ve identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we''ve grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they''ve gone on to get into serious relationships, they''re married, they''ve got kids, their lives are changing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust by the nature of the fact that they''re aging, they''re also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there''s always good talent that''s coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn''t just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We''re just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you''re growing then you''re probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I think initially we probably weren''t doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren''t really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we''re now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you''re not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you''re still about to carry those skills with you. That''s been one big change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you''re in the crucible, you''re with the client, you''re dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there''s no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we''re paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they''re working on client project then they''re billable, and if they''re billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it''s certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe''re 100% transparent about it, and because we''re transitioning them into projects where there''s already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We''re not saying, "Hey, I know you''ve been working with this person who''s senior and skilled, and we''re replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We''re saying, "We''re going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they''re doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we''re amplifying the work we''re also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what''s your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''ve some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they''re doing. Then, I''m also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you''re the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it''s amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they''ll decide what they want to do, they''ll go and study it, and then from then on it''s just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there''s a very good chance that it''ll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it''s very emotional, but once you''ve got through that stage it''s so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don''t have to go to job boards to find a job. I don''t have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I''m definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I''m going to go an reach out to them. I''m going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we''re giving them a skill that they''ll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man, I''m getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI think I said at the beginning that we''re designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we''re working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don''t really care so much about which industries we''re working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they''re trying to solve, or problem they''re trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we''re not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice, and you''re in the Boston area right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, we''re about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We''re just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it''s just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn''t matter what it is, I''m going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we''ve had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don''t think location matters as much. I think people, because that''s a paid apprenticeship, they''re willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I''d say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat''s hard, it''s really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it''s incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it''s also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That''s really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we''re pursuing that, and hopefully one day we''ll even be successful at actually doing that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAmazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI love conversation that''s challenging, and I love these topics that we''ve been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it''s value pricing, or the education stuff that we''ve just been mentioning, whether it''s culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that''s the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I''m going to respond to.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nOn Twitter I''m RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there''s two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I''m afrotrash.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRichard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAll right, talk to you soon.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nChow.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

I was asked a lot when you''re first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn''t. My response to that normally was, "Didn''t go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nKnowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You''re going to need to run Windows for this course."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn''t have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat was the criteria?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThe criteria, there really wasn''t. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn''t something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn''t know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nIt was small, small pool. You''re right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I''ve done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we''re talking I had Photoshop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI had a couple books.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou had a Macbook.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn''t just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can''t completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSorry. Did you say that it was not paid?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. The internship was not paid.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I''m not being paid, but they''re investing time and resources into me. I''m not paying for college classes right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn''t have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don''t have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you''re reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let''s see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You''re writing actual code. You''re working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here''s my design. What do you think? It''s cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here''s the design, what do you think about it? Here''s why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I''d say 70% dedicated to web, but it''s college age. You''re trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nActually, both of them did teach part-time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. There''s a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It''s not a state school. It''s a smaller private school. I''m getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There''s a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren''t. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren''t teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. What happens next in the story? You''re working at a coffee shop. You''re going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we''re doing. When you''re learning, you''re not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren''t just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat was the first time ... Again, weren''t paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I''m not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you''re working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that''s the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you''ve got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nPretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven''t changed what I''ve done for about six years. Hopefully, I''m a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I''m doing what I like. It''s fun.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nOne thing we didn''t talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nEven simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don''t work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We''re a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. Now, do you have interns? If you don''t, one day do you think you will?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nDefinitely. I don''t right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I''m about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that''s inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn''t see any other options.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, it''s pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you''re doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there''s cheap labor in there too, but there''s got to be something more than that, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren''t going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can''t promise that that''s the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone''s interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThanks. You too, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

How are you doing?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nPretty good.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn''t have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here''s where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn''t have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn''t even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What''s your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn''t be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I''d been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it''s clear, and then we''ll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I''d say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn''t doing it for everybody. It wasn''t clear enough. It wasn''t actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it''s largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It''s super good." I''m sure in a year we''ll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It''s so much better than anything I could have done on my own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s where we''re at right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat kind of things weren''t working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSome examples. I''ll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn''t really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It''s not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they''re doing a good job, and I think it''s hard to know from a Doc like that that you''re doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here''s the mid level role and here''s the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. It''s interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they''re doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they''re doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they''re doing a bad job?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we''re like, "Hey, you''re not living up to this part of the role. We''re going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It''s really helpful. Again, I''ve been in situations where I''ve felt like somebody wasn''t doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn''t able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it''s not the same as being able to point to something that we''ve all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn''t have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you''re not making it up. You''re not changing the bar. You''re not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you''re both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn''t been happening. Let''s talk about that." As opposed to, "You''re not writing code," and the designer''s like, "Well, I didn''t know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It''s actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it''s not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed''s design roles, and I know you''ve written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMaking these public, there''s probably a 2-part answer to why we think that''s important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it''s a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that''s really important. I think it''s really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it''s a good thing. It''s management''s version of open source.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere was no such thing. That''s the second reason. That''s why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it''s taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it''s probably one of the more ... It''s not the most important thing, but it''s really important. If you have bad management or people who don''t know how to do it or whatever and they''re not supportive, you''re going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that''s happened, and that''s awesome. That''s great. I''m hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that''s a really great thing to have in the world. I don''t understand why more people don''t share those. There''s no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We''re not changing the world here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI''m going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we''ll see, but we''ll go with it. You said it''s like management''s version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they''ve forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that''s a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe''ve talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven''t gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we''ve been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we''re just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don''t want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren''t a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t state a community manager just for that particular thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think so. Those aren''t the only Docs we''ve put out in the public either. We''re going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we''re able to have now, but it''s definitely come up.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what''s IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you''re not managing people directly. That''s one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What''s interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There''s no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI think that would make sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nBut I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that''s the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person''s not a good manager and he''s miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that''s a huge bummer, so what we''ve done is we parallelized the tracks, so that''s why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThen M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we''d obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What''s funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they''re managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people''s design work and stuff and impact that. I think it''s really cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nTotally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt should be in the same Doc, or if it''s not, that''s my bad and we need to add it in.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What''s the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC''s, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there''s a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we''re doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don''t know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC''s, I''ve found, is with a designer, it''s really clear what''s going on almost all the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person''s career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it''s a black box. I don''t know what''s happening in someone''s one on one. I''m not in the meeting with their other director level people that they''re in together. I''m not there so I don''t actually know what''s happening. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey walk out of a one on one and I''m not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can''t actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNew managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it''s hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you''re still holding on, you''re really in the work all the time, and you''re pissing off the designers. It''s totally what''s happening, so it''s really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I''m trying to buffer that so the designers don''t all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That''s a really tricky thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC''s or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSuccessful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they''ll have any conversation, they don''t care. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey''ll just go after it. They''re very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she''ll just try anything. If someone has an idea that''s not hers, she''ll just do it. Even if she thinks it''s totally wrong. She''ll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn''t work." Just zero ego. It''s super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don''t know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren''t a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that''s insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nManagers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI always get really nervous when someone''s concealing what they''re doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I''m going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it''s not going to be perfect. There''s going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it''s breaking or something''s not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I''ll never know and I''ll just think everything''s fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I''m sure it''s going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven''t yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI see.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nDoes that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don''t have any idea. They''re not even watching and they''re not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you''re ... Design''s the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I''d come with design work and I''d be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something''s wrong with it. I don''t know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something''s not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn''t have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn''t have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what''s going on with it, that''s a good thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, totally. I think people wish they didn''t have it, but I actually really trust people that do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that. I don''t think I''ve ever heard anybody say that. It''s really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let''s dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it''s your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you''re doing there and what you''re going to be doing there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I''ve been able to do things I don''t think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I''m responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I''m not sure they''re all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn''t exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where''s the logo?"\r\n<br><br>\r\nNo one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd that''s great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn''t able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don''t have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn''t know what that meant and now I totally know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nA year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I''m going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There''s a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We''re doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I''ve realized, at this point, that I''ve taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we''re most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team''s self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he''s built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we''re talking to them so much, all the time, and so I''m going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we''re moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWhich feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I''m really excited for them because it''s a really great change. It''ll actually, I think, empower them even more than they''ve been. It''ll be good. At the same time, like I said, I''m managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they''re starting to really lead the team as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we''re working on, and that''s not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That''s crazy, so these three people together know everything because they''re working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I''m starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that''s, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJust heckle and throw eggs and stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I''m in this weird moment where I don''t really know what''s next for me internally, and it''s something I''m talking about with my manager. I''ve been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nStay turned. I''m sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you fear that at all? Do you think there''s one day you''re going to be like, "There''s nothing left for me to do."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name''s Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She''s very literal. She''s a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can''t do that, right?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "Yes, I know. I''m just kidding." I don''t know. I''m not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You''re really great at making yourself not indispensable. You''re really good at planting yourself obsolete."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nShe was saying that, it''s like a compliment. It''s a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It''s like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I''m setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn''t matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It''s not my team. It''s BuzzFeed''s team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I''m not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don''t talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don''t worry too much about it as long as I feel like I''m doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I''m responsible for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so awesome. It''s very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You''re taking the opposite approach.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn''t have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn''t have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who''s really good at that stuff? It''s Cap." She pinged me one night and she''s like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I''ve taken that on, and I''ve been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it''s opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt doesn''t have to be even design related. I''m excited to figure out what other stuff I''m able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That''s why I''m probably talking about it so much right now, where I''m like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He''s a great design manager, but I don''t feel like-" ... I don''t think that''s right. I think it''s just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure what''s next, but I don''t really fear it too much.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you''ve got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s vital. I think like measuring, people don''t put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It''s funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn''t matter if it''s on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I''ll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn''t really pay attention to the language, it wouldn''t be effective. It probably wouldn''t be clear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think there''s a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they''re doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that''s not going to take hold as much as if you have something you''re referring back to constantly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRefer to these documents a lot?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle''s Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we''re using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that''s the person I don''t want to be so bad.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 2006, I recall that I said-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI trademark it myself. Terrible.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nLast topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here''s the way it is," and that''s not actually accurate, but it''s the way that you want it to be, so you''re setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it''s really hard to hire good people, but also, if you''re the one trying to be hired, it''s really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think hiring great people, I think people think it''s hard. I don''t find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It''s funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It''s just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don''t know. I do not find that difficult. I think there''s a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn''t use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they''d send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey weren''t in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there''s no way it''s not the recruiter''s fault. It''s a sniff test for, as a designer, I''m like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It''s these weird things that people won''t think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who''s in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn''t really know about product design at Etsy and didn''t know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that''s why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I''m getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It''s weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that''s why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that''s actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you''ll find people who want to work that way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you''re trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn''t know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That''s been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don''t know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that''s okay. I don''t think I''ve ever hired anybody out of that. I don''t think anybody''s ever looked for a job that way so far. I don''t know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don''t post job listings for design, so no one would even know we''re hiring, and so we reach out super ... It''s all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy don''t you post job postings?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you''re talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s like just doing the math about what''s the most effective for us. I don''t know if that''s right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere''s this interesting thing that I''ve noticed with it, and I think you''d probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they''re not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we''re having problems with diversity. We''re working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You''re like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it''s up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that''s not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think that''s really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don''t know. It''s not something I think we''re super conscious of all the time, but it''s definitely there in the background. There''s a background process ring where you''re like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that''s probably a good thing in the end.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don''t mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t if I''d say everything to get email about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nKind of an oxymoron.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know. Every once in a while I''ll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It''s funny. I don''t write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I''m writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It''s my thought process that I''m going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it''s really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don''t know. I get random emails from people. They''re like, "I''m coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It''s cool to me how their designers are like ... I''ve met designers that are all over the career pathway where they''re just starting out. I met someone the other day who''s transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that''s been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn''t normally meet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. We''re can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy website has my email address on it so it''s just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Thanks for having me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMy pleasure. Take it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd><dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dt>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dt>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I''m fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We''re trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It''s with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it''s just aarron ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Nice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... and my website is aarronwalter.com, so ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, thank you!\r\n</dd></dl>'),

There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I''m fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We''re trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It''s with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it''s just aarron ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Nice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... and my website is aarronwalter.com, so ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, thank you!\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2032, 216, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator.

I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much.

(2048, 217, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback.

If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ...

Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ...

(2080, 219, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2096, 220, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2112, 221, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2128, 222, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2144, 223, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2160, 224, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2176, 225, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2192, 226, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisah </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2208, 227, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2224, 228, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2240, 229, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2256, 230, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2272, 231, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd></dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt> </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need?

(2288, 232, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2306, 233, 'transcript', '\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall. Anytime.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

(2322, 234, 'transcript', '\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall.

(2338, 235, 'transcript', '\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall. Anytime.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

How are you doing?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nPretty good.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn''t have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here''s where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn''t have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn''t even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What''s your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn''t be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I''d been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it''s clear, and then we''ll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I''d say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn''t doing it for everybody. It wasn''t clear enough. It wasn''t actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it''s largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It''s super good." I''m sure in a year we''ll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It''s so much better than anything I could have done on my own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s where we''re at right now.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat kind of things weren''t working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSome examples. I''ll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn''t really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It''s not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they''re doing a good job, and I think it''s hard to know from a Doc like that that you''re doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here''s the mid level role and here''s the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. It''s interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they''re doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they''re doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they''re doing a bad job?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we''re like, "Hey, you''re not living up to this part of the role. We''re going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It''s really helpful. Again, I''ve been in situations where I''ve felt like somebody wasn''t doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn''t able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it''s not the same as being able to point to something that we''ve all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn''t have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you''re not making it up. You''re not changing the bar. You''re not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you''re both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn''t been happening. Let''s talk about that." As opposed to, "You''re not writing code," and the designer''s like, "Well, I didn''t know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It''s actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it''s not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed''s design roles, and I know you''ve written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMaking these public, there''s probably a 2-part answer to why we think that''s important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it''s a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that''s really important. I think it''s really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it''s a good thing. It''s management''s version of open source.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere was no such thing. That''s the second reason. That''s why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it''s taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it''s probably one of the more ... It''s not the most important thing, but it''s really important. If you have bad management or people who don''t know how to do it or whatever and they''re not supportive, you''re going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that''s happened, and that''s awesome. That''s great. I''m hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that''s a really great thing to have in the world. I don''t understand why more people don''t share those. There''s no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We''re not changing the world here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI''m going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we''ll see, but we''ll go with it. You said it''s like management''s version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they''ve forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that''s a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe''ve talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven''t gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we''ve been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we''re just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don''t want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren''t a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t state a community manager just for that particular thing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think so. Those aren''t the only Docs we''ve put out in the public either. We''re going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we''re able to have now, but it''s definitely come up.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what''s IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you''re not managing people directly. That''s one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What''s interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There''s no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI think that would make sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nBut I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that''s the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person''s not a good manager and he''s miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that''s a huge bummer, so what we''ve done is we parallelized the tracks, so that''s why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThen M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we''d obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What''s funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they''re managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people''s design work and stuff and impact that. I think it''s really cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nTotally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt should be in the same Doc, or if it''s not, that''s my bad and we need to add it in.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What''s the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC''s, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there''s a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we''re doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don''t know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC''s, I''ve found, is with a designer, it''s really clear what''s going on almost all the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person''s career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it''s a black box. I don''t know what''s happening in someone''s one on one. I''m not in the meeting with their other director level people that they''re in together. I''m not there so I don''t actually know what''s happening. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey walk out of a one on one and I''m not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can''t actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNew managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it''s hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you''re still holding on, you''re really in the work all the time, and you''re pissing off the designers. It''s totally what''s happening, so it''s really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I''m trying to buffer that so the designers don''t all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That''s a really tricky thing to do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC''s or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSuccessful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they''ll have any conversation, they don''t care. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey''ll just go after it. They''re very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she''ll just try anything. If someone has an idea that''s not hers, she''ll just do it. Even if she thinks it''s totally wrong. She''ll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn''t work." Just zero ego. It''s super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don''t know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren''t a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that''s insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nManagers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI always get really nervous when someone''s concealing what they''re doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I''m going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it''s not going to be perfect. There''s going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it''s breaking or something''s not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I''ll never know and I''ll just think everything''s fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I''m sure it''s going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven''t yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI see.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nDoes that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don''t have any idea. They''re not even watching and they''re not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you''re ... Design''s the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I''d come with design work and I''d be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something''s wrong with it. I don''t know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something''s not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn''t have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn''t have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what''s going on with it, that''s a good thing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, totally. I think people wish they didn''t have it, but I actually really trust people that do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that. I don''t think I''ve ever heard anybody say that. It''s really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let''s dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it''s your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you''re doing there and what you''re going to be doing there.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I''ve been able to do things I don''t think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I''m responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I''m not sure they''re all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn''t exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where''s the logo?"\r\n<br><br>\r\nNo one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd that''s great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn''t able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don''t have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn''t know what that meant and now I totally know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nA year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I''m going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There''s a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We''re doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I''ve realized, at this point, that I''ve taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we''re most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team''s self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he''s built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we''re talking to them so much, all the time, and so I''m going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we''re moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWhich feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I''m really excited for them because it''s a really great change. It''ll actually, I think, empower them even more than they''ve been. It''ll be good. At the same time, like I said, I''m managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they''re starting to really lead the team as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we''re working on, and that''s not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That''s crazy, so these three people together know everything because they''re working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I''m starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that''s, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJust heckle and throw eggs and stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I''m in this weird moment where I don''t really know what''s next for me internally, and it''s something I''m talking about with my manager. I''ve been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nStay turned. I''m sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you fear that at all? Do you think there''s one day you''re going to be like, "There''s nothing left for me to do."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name''s Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She''s very literal. She''s a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can''t do that, right?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "Yes, I know. I''m just kidding." I don''t know. I''m not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You''re really great at making yourself not indispensable. You''re really good at planting yourself obsolete."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nShe was saying that, it''s like a compliment. It''s a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It''s like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I''m setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn''t matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It''s not my team. It''s BuzzFeed''s team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I''m not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don''t talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don''t worry too much about it as long as I feel like I''m doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I''m responsible for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so awesome. It''s very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You''re taking the opposite approach.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn''t have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn''t have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who''s really good at that stuff? It''s Cap." She pinged me one night and she''s like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I''ve taken that on, and I''ve been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it''s opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt doesn''t have to be even design related. I''m excited to figure out what other stuff I''m able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That''s why I''m probably talking about it so much right now, where I''m like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He''s a great design manager, but I don''t feel like-" ... I don''t think that''s right. I think it''s just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure what''s next, but I don''t really fear it too much.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you''ve got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s vital. I think like measuring, people don''t put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It''s funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn''t matter if it''s on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I''ll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn''t really pay attention to the language, it wouldn''t be effective. It probably wouldn''t be clear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think there''s a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they''re doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that''s not going to take hold as much as if you have something you''re referring back to constantly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRefer to these documents a lot?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle''s Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we''re using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that''s the person I don''t want to be so bad.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 2006, I recall that I said-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI trademark it myself. Terrible.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nLast topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here''s the way it is," and that''s not actually accurate, but it''s the way that you want it to be, so you''re setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it''s really hard to hire good people, but also, if you''re the one trying to be hired, it''s really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think hiring great people, I think people think it''s hard. I don''t find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It''s funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It''s just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don''t know. I do not find that difficult. I think there''s a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn''t use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they''d send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey weren''t in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there''s no way it''s not the recruiter''s fault. It''s a sniff test for, as a designer, I''m like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It''s these weird things that people won''t think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who''s in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn''t really know about product design at Etsy and didn''t know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that''s why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I''m getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It''s weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that''s why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that''s actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you''ll find people who want to work that way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you''re trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn''t know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That''s been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don''t know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that''s okay. I don''t think I''ve ever hired anybody out of that. I don''t think anybody''s ever looked for a job that way so far. I don''t know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don''t post job listings for design, so no one would even know we''re hiring, and so we reach out super ... It''s all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy don''t you post job postings?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you''re talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s like just doing the math about what''s the most effective for us. I don''t know if that''s right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere''s this interesting thing that I''ve noticed with it, and I think you''d probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they''re not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we''re having problems with diversity. We''re working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You''re like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it''s up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that''s not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think that''s really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don''t know. It''s not something I think we''re super conscious of all the time, but it''s definitely there in the background. There''s a background process ring where you''re like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that''s probably a good thing in the end.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don''t mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t if I''d say everything to get email about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nKind of an oxymoron.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know. Every once in a while I''ll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It''s funny. I don''t write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I''m writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It''s my thought process that I''m going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it''s really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don''t know. I get random emails from people. They''re like, "I''m coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It''s cool to me how their designers are like ... I''ve met designers that are all over the career pathway where they''re just starting out. I met someone the other day who''s transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that''s been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn''t normally meet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. We''re can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy website has my email address on it so it''s just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Thanks for having me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMy pleasure. Take it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

Can you talk a little bit about that, and tell us about what that looked like, and what that experience was like for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, definitely. I''m happy to do that. For me, a definitely interesting approach. I was asked a lot when you''re first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn''t. My response to that normally was, "Didn''t go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nKnowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You''re going to need to run Windows for this course."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn''t have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat was the criteria?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThe criteria, there really wasn''t. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn''t something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn''t know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nIt was small, small pool. You''re right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I''ve done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we''re talking I had Photoshop.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI had a couple books.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou had a Macbook.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn''t just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can''t completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSorry. Did you say that it was not paid?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. The internship was not paid.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I''m not being paid, but they''re investing time and resources into me. I''m not paying for college classes right now.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn''t have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don''t have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you''re reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let''s see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You''re writing actual code. You''re working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here''s my design. What do you think? It''s cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here''s the design, what do you think about it? Here''s why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I''d say 70% dedicated to web, but it''s college age. You''re trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nActually, both of them did teach part-time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. There''s a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It''s not a state school. It''s a smaller private school. I''m getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There''s a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren''t. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren''t teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. What happens next in the story? You''re working at a coffee shop. You''re going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we''re doing. When you''re learning, you''re not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren''t just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat was the first time ... Again, weren''t paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I''m not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you''re working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that''s the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you''ve got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nPretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven''t changed what I''ve done for about six years. Hopefully, I''m a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I''m doing what I like. It''s fun.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nOne thing we didn''t talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nEven simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don''t work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We''re a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. Now, do you have interns? If you don''t, one day do you think you will?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nDefinitely. I don''t right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I''m about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that''s inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn''t see any other options.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, it''s pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you''re doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there''s cheap labor in there too, but there''s got to be something more than that, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren''t going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can''t promise that that''s the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone''s interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThanks. You too, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We''ve done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we''ve been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we''ve gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we''ve got better ideas." Or, "We''ve got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe had been doing internships and we''d been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it''s a fairly new idea. When I got back, I''d asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let''s just try it, let''s just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Now you had mentioned there''s a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you''d kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let''s go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don''t know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What''s the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it''s something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what''s coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let''s say you''re a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that''s like, or in some cases if you''re in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you''re taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you''re creating.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason why it''s different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let''s have this person here for a short amount of time while they''re doing this thing." It''s almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you''re putting you''re time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThe selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we''ve been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they''re trying to get out of the program. We''ll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we''ll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they''re going to work on things that we challenge them with. We''re going to provide them with a product, we''re going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe''re going to assess them across different criteria. We''re going to look at their actual work, so if they''re designers we''re going to look at their design skills. If they''re developers we''re going to look at that. If they''re a combination we''re going to look at both. What we''re also secretly doing is we''re seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it''s like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We''re looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we''ll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we''ve got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they''ll go through that, the 15 week program.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It sounds like you''re looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you''re looking for cues that they''re going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThey''re the same. We''re looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we''re definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We''re looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can''t necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture''s different that, but that''s something that we have no control over.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don''t?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we''re in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We''re actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we''re starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We''re like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn''t have let all of them go and find other jobs." We''re pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They''re part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that''s one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nIn the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn''t it work for apprenticeships too.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. They''ve gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who''s who, it''s amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that''s a pretty strong group of people\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, that''s amazing. What kind of person doesn''t make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you''re like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who''s designing a digital product. We''re looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they''re unable to communicate it effectively, or they''re unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don''t work well in teams and they don''t collaborate well. Those are the things that we''ve identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we''ve grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they''ve gone on to get into serious relationships, they''re married, they''ve got kids, their lives are changing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust by the nature of the fact that they''re aging, they''re also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there''s always good talent that''s coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn''t just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We''re just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you''re growing then you''re probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I think initially we probably weren''t doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren''t really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we''re now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you''re not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you''re still about to carry those skills with you. That''s been one big change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you''re in the crucible, you''re with the client, you''re dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there''s no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we''re paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they''re working on client project then they''re billable, and if they''re billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it''s certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe''re 100% transparent about it, and because we''re transitioning them into projects where there''s already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We''re not saying, "Hey, I know you''ve been working with this person who''s senior and skilled, and we''re replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We''re saying, "We''re going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they''re doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we''re amplifying the work we''re also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what''s your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''ve some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they''re doing. Then, I''m also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you''re the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it''s amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they''ll decide what they want to do, they''ll go and study it, and then from then on it''s just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there''s a very good chance that it''ll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it''s very emotional, but once you''ve got through that stage it''s so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don''t have to go to job boards to find a job. I don''t have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I''m definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I''m going to go an reach out to them. I''m going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we''re giving them a skill that they''ll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man, I''m getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI think I said at the beginning that we''re designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we''re working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don''t really care so much about which industries we''re working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they''re trying to solve, or problem they''re trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we''re not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice, and you''re in the Boston area right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, we''re about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We''re just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it''s just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn''t matter what it is, I''m going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we''ve had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don''t think location matters as much. I think people, because that''s a paid apprenticeship, they''re willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I''d say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat''s hard, it''s really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it''s incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it''s also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That''s really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we''re pursuing that, and hopefully one day we''ll even be successful at actually doing that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAmazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI love conversation that''s challenging, and I love these topics that we''ve been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it''s value pricing, or the education stuff that we''ve just been mentioning, whether it''s culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that''s the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I''m going to respond to.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nOn Twitter I''m RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there''s two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I''m afrotrash.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRichard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAll right, talk to you soon.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nChow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

(2426, 240, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much.

(2445, 242, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected.

(2463, 244, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHey, Cap.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nHey. How''s it going?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGoing well. How are you doing?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nPretty good.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn''t have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here''s where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn''t have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn''t even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What''s your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn''t be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I''d been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it''s clear, and then we''ll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I''d say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn''t doing it for everybody. It wasn''t clear enough. It wasn''t actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it''s largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It''s super good." I''m sure in a year we''ll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It''s so much better than anything I could have done on my own.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s where we''re at right now.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat kind of things weren''t working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSome examples. I''ll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn''t really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It''s not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they''re doing a good job, and I think it''s hard to know from a Doc like that that you''re doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here''s the mid level role and here''s the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. It''s interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they''re doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they''re doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they''re doing a bad job?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we''re like, "Hey, you''re not living up to this part of the role. We''re going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It''s really helpful. Again, I''ve been in situations where I''ve felt like somebody wasn''t doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn''t able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it''s not the same as being able to point to something that we''ve all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn''t have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you''re not making it up. You''re not changing the bar. You''re not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you''re both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn''t been happening. Let''s talk about that." As opposed to, "You''re not writing code," and the designer''s like, "Well, I didn''t know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It''s actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it''s not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed''s design roles, and I know you''ve written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMaking these public, there''s probably a 2-part answer to why we think that''s important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it''s a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that''s really important. I think it''s really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it''s a good thing. It''s management''s version of open source.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere was no such thing. That''s the second reason. That''s why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it''s taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it''s probably one of the more ... It''s not the most important thing, but it''s really important. If you have bad management or people who don''t know how to do it or whatever and they''re not supportive, you''re going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that''s happened, and that''s awesome. That''s great. I''m hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that''s a really great thing to have in the world. I don''t understand why more people don''t share those. There''s no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We''re not changing the world here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI''m going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we''ll see, but we''ll go with it. You said it''s like management''s version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they''ve forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that''s a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe''ve talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven''t gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we''ve been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we''re just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don''t want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren''t a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t state a community manager just for that particular thing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think so. Those aren''t the only Docs we''ve put out in the public either. We''re going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we''re able to have now, but it''s definitely come up.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what''s IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you''re not managing people directly. That''s one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What''s interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There''s no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI think that would make sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nBut I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that''s the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person''s not a good manager and he''s miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that''s a huge bummer, so what we''ve done is we parallelized the tracks, so that''s why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThen M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we''d obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What''s funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they''re managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people''s design work and stuff and impact that. I think it''s really cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nTotally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt should be in the same Doc, or if it''s not, that''s my bad and we need to add it in.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What''s the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC''s, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there''s a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we''re doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don''t know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC''s, I''ve found, is with a designer, it''s really clear what''s going on almost all the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person''s career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it''s a black box. I don''t know what''s happening in someone''s one on one. I''m not in the meeting with their other director level people that they''re in together. I''m not there so I don''t actually know what''s happening. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey walk out of a one on one and I''m not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can''t actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNew managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it''s hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you''re still holding on, you''re really in the work all the time, and you''re pissing off the designers. It''s totally what''s happening, so it''s really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I''m trying to buffer that so the designers don''t all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That''s a really tricky thing to do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC''s or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSuccessful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they''ll have any conversation, they don''t care. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey''ll just go after it. They''re very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she''ll just try anything. If someone has an idea that''s not hers, she''ll just do it. Even if she thinks it''s totally wrong. She''ll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn''t work." Just zero ego. It''s super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don''t know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren''t a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that''s insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nManagers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI always get really nervous when someone''s concealing what they''re doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I''m going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it''s not going to be perfect. There''s going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it''s breaking or something''s not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I''ll never know and I''ll just think everything''s fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I''m sure it''s going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven''t yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI see.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nDoes that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don''t have any idea. They''re not even watching and they''re not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you''re ... Design''s the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I''d come with design work and I''d be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something''s wrong with it. I don''t know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something''s not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn''t have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn''t have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what''s going on with it, that''s a good thing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, totally. I think people wish they didn''t have it, but I actually really trust people that do.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that. I don''t think I''ve ever heard anybody say that. It''s really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let''s dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it''s your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you''re doing there and what you''re going to be doing there.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I''ve been able to do things I don''t think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I''m responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I''m not sure they''re all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn''t exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where''s the logo?"\r\n<br><br>\r\nNo one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd that''s great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn''t able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don''t have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn''t know what that meant and now I totally know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nA year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I''m going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There''s a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We''re doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I''ve realized, at this point, that I''ve taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we''re most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team''s self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he''s built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we''re talking to them so much, all the time, and so I''m going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we''re moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWhich feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I''m really excited for them because it''s a really great change. It''ll actually, I think, empower them even more than they''ve been. It''ll be good. At the same time, like I said, I''m managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they''re starting to really lead the team as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we''re working on, and that''s not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That''s crazy, so these three people together know everything because they''re working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I''m starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that''s, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJust heckle and throw eggs and stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I''m in this weird moment where I don''t really know what''s next for me internally, and it''s something I''m talking about with my manager. I''ve been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nStay turned. I''m sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you fear that at all? Do you think there''s one day you''re going to be like, "There''s nothing left for me to do."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name''s Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She''s very literal. She''s a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can''t do that, right?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "Yes, I know. I''m just kidding." I don''t know. I''m not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You''re really great at making yourself not indispensable. You''re really good at planting yourself obsolete."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nShe was saying that, it''s like a compliment. It''s a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It''s like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I''m setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn''t matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It''s not my team. It''s BuzzFeed''s team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I''m not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don''t talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don''t worry too much about it as long as I feel like I''m doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I''m responsible for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so awesome. It''s very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You''re taking the opposite approach.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn''t have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn''t have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who''s really good at that stuff? It''s Cap." She pinged me one night and she''s like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I''ve taken that on, and I''ve been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it''s opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt doesn''t have to be even design related. I''m excited to figure out what other stuff I''m able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That''s why I''m probably talking about it so much right now, where I''m like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He''s a great design manager, but I don''t feel like-" ... I don''t think that''s right. I think it''s just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure what''s next, but I don''t really fear it too much.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you''ve got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s vital. I think like measuring, people don''t put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It''s funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn''t matter if it''s on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I''ll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn''t really pay attention to the language, it wouldn''t be effective. It probably wouldn''t be clear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think there''s a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they''re doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that''s not going to take hold as much as if you have something you''re referring back to constantly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRefer to these documents a lot?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle''s Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we''re using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that''s the person I don''t want to be so bad.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 2006, I recall that I said-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI trademark it myself. Terrible.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nLast topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here''s the way it is," and that''s not actually accurate, but it''s the way that you want it to be, so you''re setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it''s really hard to hire good people, but also, if you''re the one trying to be hired, it''s really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think hiring great people, I think people think it''s hard. I don''t find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It''s funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It''s just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don''t know. I do not find that difficult. I think there''s a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn''t use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they''d send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey weren''t in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there''s no way it''s not the recruiter''s fault. It''s a sniff test for, as a designer, I''m like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It''s these weird things that people won''t think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who''s in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn''t really know about product design at Etsy and didn''t know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that''s why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I''m getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It''s weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that''s why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that''s actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you''ll find people who want to work that way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you''re trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn''t know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That''s been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don''t know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that''s okay. I don''t think I''ve ever hired anybody out of that. I don''t think anybody''s ever looked for a job that way so far. I don''t know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don''t post job listings for design, so no one would even know we''re hiring, and so we reach out super ... It''s all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy don''t you post job postings?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you''re talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s like just doing the math about what''s the most effective for us. I don''t know if that''s right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere''s this interesting thing that I''ve noticed with it, and I think you''d probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they''re not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we''re having problems with diversity. We''re working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You''re like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it''s up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that''s not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think that''s really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don''t know. It''s not something I think we''re super conscious of all the time, but it''s definitely there in the background. There''s a background process ring where you''re like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that''s probably a good thing in the end.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don''t mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t if I''d say everything to get email about.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nKind of an oxymoron.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know. Every once in a while I''ll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It''s funny. I don''t write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I''m writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It''s my thought process that I''m going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it''s really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don''t know. I get random emails from people. They''re like, "I''m coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It''s cool to me how their designers are like ... I''ve met designers that are all over the career pathway where they''re just starting out. I met someone the other day who''s transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that''s been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn''t normally meet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. We''re can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy website has my email address on it so it''s just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Thanks for having me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMy pleasure. Take it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

(2484, 246, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHi Courtney.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nHey Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''ve had a really interesting start to your career, which is that somebody gave you a chance and you started through a really intense apprenticeship. Can you talk a little bit about that, and tell us about what that looked like, and what that experience was like for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, definitely. I''m happy to do that. For me, a definitely interesting approach. I was asked a lot when you''re first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn''t. My response to that normally was, "Didn''t go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nKnowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You''re going to need to run Windows for this course."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn''t have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat was the criteria?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThe criteria, there really wasn''t. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn''t something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn''t know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nIt was small, small pool. You''re right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I''ve done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we''re talking I had Photoshop.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI had a couple books.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou had a Macbook.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn''t just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can''t completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSorry. Did you say that it was not paid?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. The internship was not paid.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I''m not being paid, but they''re investing time and resources into me. I''m not paying for college classes right now.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn''t have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don''t have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you''re reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let''s see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You''re writing actual code. You''re working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here''s my design. What do you think? It''s cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here''s the design, what do you think about it? Here''s why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I''d say 70% dedicated to web, but it''s college age. You''re trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nActually, both of them did teach part-time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. There''s a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It''s not a state school. It''s a smaller private school. I''m getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There''s a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren''t. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren''t teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. What happens next in the story? You''re working at a coffee shop. You''re going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we''re doing. When you''re learning, you''re not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren''t just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat was the first time ... Again, weren''t paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I''m not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you''re working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that''s the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you''ve got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nPretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven''t changed what I''ve done for about six years. Hopefully, I''m a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I''m doing what I like. It''s fun.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nOne thing we didn''t talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nEven simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don''t work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We''re a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. Now, do you have interns? If you don''t, one day do you think you will?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nDefinitely. I don''t right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I''m about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that''s inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn''t see any other options.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, it''s pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you''re doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there''s cheap labor in there too, but there''s got to be something more than that, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren''t going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can''t promise that that''s the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone''s interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThanks. You too, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2508, 248, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com.

What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We''ve done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we''ve been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we''ve gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we''ve got better ideas." Or, "We''ve got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe had been doing internships and we''d been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it''s a fairly new idea. When I got back, I''d asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let''s just try it, let''s just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Now you had mentioned there''s a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you''d kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let''s go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don''t know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What''s the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it''s something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what''s coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let''s say you''re a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that''s like, or in some cases if you''re in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you''re taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you''re creating.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason why it''s different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let''s have this person here for a short amount of time while they''re doing this thing." It''s almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you''re putting you''re time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThe selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we''ve been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they''re trying to get out of the program. We''ll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we''ll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they''re going to work on things that we challenge them with. We''re going to provide them with a product, we''re going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe''re going to assess them across different criteria. We''re going to look at their actual work, so if they''re designers we''re going to look at their design skills. If they''re developers we''re going to look at that. If they''re a combination we''re going to look at both. What we''re also secretly doing is we''re seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it''s like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We''re looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we''ll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we''ve got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they''ll go through that, the 15 week program.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It sounds like you''re looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you''re looking for cues that they''re going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThey''re the same. We''re looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we''re definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We''re looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can''t necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture''s different that, but that''s something that we have no control over.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don''t?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we''re in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We''re actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we''re starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We''re like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn''t have let all of them go and find other jobs." We''re pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They''re part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that''s one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nIn the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn''t it work for apprenticeships too.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. They''ve gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who''s who, it''s amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that''s a pretty strong group of people\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, that''s amazing. What kind of person doesn''t make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you''re like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who''s designing a digital product. We''re looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they''re unable to communicate it effectively, or they''re unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don''t work well in teams and they don''t collaborate well. Those are the things that we''ve identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we''ve grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they''ve gone on to get into serious relationships, they''re married, they''ve got kids, their lives are changing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust by the nature of the fact that they''re aging, they''re also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there''s always good talent that''s coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn''t just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We''re just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you''re growing then you''re probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I think initially we probably weren''t doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren''t really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we''re now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you''re not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you''re still about to carry those skills with you. That''s been one big change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you''re in the crucible, you''re with the client, you''re dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there''s no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we''re paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they''re working on client project then they''re billable, and if they''re billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it''s certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe''re 100% transparent about it, and because we''re transitioning them into projects where there''s already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We''re not saying, "Hey, I know you''ve been working with this person who''s senior and skilled, and we''re replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We''re saying, "We''re going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they''re doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we''re amplifying the work we''re also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what''s your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''ve some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they''re doing. Then, I''m also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you''re the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it''s amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they''ll decide what they want to do, they''ll go and study it, and then from then on it''s just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there''s a very good chance that it''ll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it''s very emotional, but once you''ve got through that stage it''s so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don''t have to go to job boards to find a job. I don''t have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I''m definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I''m going to go an reach out to them. I''m going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we''re giving them a skill that they''ll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man, I''m getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI think I said at the beginning that we''re designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we''re working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don''t really care so much about which industries we''re working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they''re trying to solve, or problem they''re trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we''re not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice, and you''re in the Boston area right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, we''re about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We''re just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it''s just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn''t matter what it is, I''m going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we''ve had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don''t think location matters as much. I think people, because that''s a paid apprenticeship, they''re willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I''d say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat''s hard, it''s really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it''s incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it''s also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That''s really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we''re pursuing that, and hopefully one day we''ll even be successful at actually doing that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAmazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI love conversation that''s challenging, and I love these topics that we''ve been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it''s value pricing, or the education stuff that we''ve just been mentioning, whether it''s culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that''s the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I''m going to respond to.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nOn Twitter I''m RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there''s two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I''m afrotrash.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRichard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAll right, talk to you soon.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nChow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n'),

(2578, 254, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2600, 257, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2648, 260, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much.

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&quot;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&quot; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/"><blockquote>"It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband."</blockquote><img src= "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/green/img/twitter.png" alt="tweet this quote"/></a></div>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">\r\n\r\n</blockquote></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2746, 267, 'transcript', '<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">Tweet this quote</a>\r\n\r\n</blockquote></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">Tweet this quote</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship.

Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd></dl>\r\n\r\n<dl><dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd></dl>'),

(2782, 269, 'transcript', '<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>So, I don''t think I''ve actually told anyone this, uh, mostly cuz I probably just forgot about the impetus, but the reason why I wrote Coding is a Privilege, uh, is because I read this really ridiculous New York Times feature. Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">Tweet this quote</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

Um, it was a, it was kind of a really fluffy, positive, like uplifting piece about how a lot of recent college grads who have Humanities majors, you know, they can''t find real jobs, so they turn to coding boot camps, like General Assembly, and the, the focus of the piece was, you know, these people didn''t really have a lot of job prospects, but they found these programs, and now they have really great, uh, 6-figure jobs as engineers.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, (laughs) it was a very positive piece, and I read it, and I was like, okay, well, this is great for those people, but it overlooks so many realities regarding any quality and privilege, and it kind of made me sad and a little frustrated cuz those programs are becoming really popular now, and it''s being sold in that way, right? Like, you''re given six or eight weeks of coding training and then, boom. You get a $100,000 salary as an engineer. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="blockquote"><blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a  class="tweet-link"href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&ldquo;It was quite a big financial barrier to use a computer that was sitting at home because people couldn''t afford home broadband.&rdquo; http://localhost/wordpress/2016/06/01/undersponsored-and-overmentored/">Tweet this quote</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You think that''s not, that''s not true? You, that doesn''t happen?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I think for, definitely for some people, it happens for sure. I definitely personally know of people where it''s worked out really well for them, but I think the thing that they aren''t quite honest about is, you know, they don''t really release acceptance rates, like job or employment rates out of those programs. Um, it''s really unclear. Uh, the, the kind of quality, the bar of quality, uh, really varies from program to program, and, you know, I don''t think it''s, I think you can certainly learn coding, uh, in eight weeks. I think it takes a lot longer than that to become, uh, a great engineer or a great designer.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, so I think there, I definitely have problems, uh, with the way that they''re packaging it, um, but I think more so than that, the price tag that, uh, is put on some of these programs. I think the average is, like, $11,000 for the entire program. It''s a pretty high cost, and, you know, when I, so I actually, my career, I, I didn''t start working in tech or I didn''t start as an engineer. Um, I used to work as a consultant.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, interesting.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And, yeah, so I, I graduated with, um, a degree in Medieval History and Sociology, and did this consulting job. I quit, uh, cuz it just wasn''t my cup of tea after, after about a year, (clears throat), and I took kind of like a 6-month break to do some soul searching and some (laughs) design portfolio, um, creating cuz I, I was like, oh, like, this tech thing is cool and I really like design and it was something that I''ve always really enjoyed as a young person poking around on the Internet. Uh, maybe I can make a career out of this, and I remember looking into a program like General Assembly, um, but I just simply didn''t have the money to pay for it, and I just wondered, like, you know, there are so many people out there in my shoes right now who want a change. Like, they want this mobility from, uh, uh, a certain career field into a field like engineering where they can, you know, have that 6-figure salary, but in order to get there, to pay, you know, $11,000, that''s a lot to ask, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Totally\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So, so.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That was the main, the main impetus for that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nSo, can you talk a little bit more, more about that? So, these, these schools are, are great. They''re providing opportunities, but the barrier entry is really high, right? Like, e-e-even just the cost of it; $11,000 is not a small amount of money to shell out, so, um, y-, in, in that article you kind of give a couple of suggestions. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that. So, what does somebody do instead of saying, "Okay, I want to be an engineer. Um, I don''t have $11,000. What do I do instead?" Like, what are some things that, you know, cuz I think there''s a lot of people who are interested in solving that problem, sort of agree that that''s a problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>But maybe don''t know what to do about that, so, uh, you know, maybe, you share, we can share some thoughts about-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What can we all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, definitely. Um, so, I think I wrote, uh, well, I did write a followup article to that piece cuz I think very rightly a lot of people responded to the first piece, being like, "Well, you know, there are so many free online resources to teach people how to code, and this should not be a barrier. Uh, if you, if you really want to learn, you can learn." And, my response was, like, "Yes, that''s true. There are tons of online resources, but this is more than just something that stems from individual resources. It''s more of a systemic problem. Um, and I think it-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I think it really comes down to education and seeing the skill of engineering and coding as, um, something that should be taught in schools from an early age and not ... It shouldn''t be, um, kept from kids who might not be in a great school district or what have you. Um, beyond that, I think I wrote about, you know, it''s, it''s about, first, you have to have the awareness of engineering as a field and as a potential career for yourself. Um, I think I was really lucky because I, you know, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money, but I still had a computer at home, and, I had access to the Internet, and I was able to poke around on sites like MySpace and Neopets and (laughs) create silly sites for myself, so I had some sort of awareness of, like, okay, the Internet is a thing, and I have the power to make things for it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUm, I don''t think that''s the case for a lot of people and especially young people. Like, they just, they''re, they''re not exposed to the right types of role models or mentors who look like them or come from a similar background as them, um, succeeding and, like, going into engineering, so they just don''t know that it''s an option, so I think that''s really, like, the biggest, um, barrier to entry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Gotcha. Th-th, I want to go back to one thing that you said, it, uh, just a minute ago. You said it, it takes a long time to be a good designer, to be a good engineer. Maybe can you talk a little bit about that? Um, why does it take a long time, um, and is that sort of antithetical to the idea of, you know, do this course for 11 weeks-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd all of a sudden, you get a 6-figure salary?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Could we talk a little bit about, about that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. So, I think, um, to become a great designer or a great engineer, and this is something I''ve learned over the past few years that I''ve been working now, um, it''s more than the skills that you have. It''s more than the hard skills. Having a job and succeeding at it, uh, it usually comes down to people and relationships, like the relationships that you build with those people. It''s about trusting you team. It''s about garnering trust within your team. Um, it''s so much more than just being able to write a few lines of code or being able to design, like a really bomb (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I don''t know, interface or what-whatever in Sketch. Like, you could be a Sketch master, but still be a poor designer because you just don''t know how to read people or, like, interact with them, get, uh, get along with them, and, and get things done as a team, so it''s h-, it''s hard, but you definitely, you certainly need those hard skills, for sure, and I think courses like General Assembly give you those tools, but it takes so much more to really excel.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Now, you work at Vox. Can you tell us a little bit about what you do at Vox and how that all plays into your work at Vox? I mean, do you have mentors at Vox? Are you mentoring other designers-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Or other engineers there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure. Uh, so, right now, I''m a design director at Vox. I work on the revenue team, uh, primarily on revenue platforms, and I''ve been there for a little over two years now, and, um, currently we don''t actually have any formal mentorship program set up. Uh, I know we''ve been talking about it, but it''s, it hasn''t really been anything formal, um, and to be honest, I, I did have one formal mentorship at my first job out of school. Um, I worked at, uh, this place called Profit. It was a brand strategy consulting firm, um, and as most consulting firms go, it''s, it was very, like, bureaucratic and organized, um, and, yeah, I had a, I had a formal mentor there, but I don''t think I''ve ever ... I hope she doesn''t listen to this podcast. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But I don''t think I''ve ever gotten anything out of formal mentorships. Um, I think I''ve really had a lot of success in, like informal mentorship. Um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What''s the difference between the two? Like, maybe you can explain that. What''s the difference between formal mentorship and in, informal? Like, how does it, how does that make a difference for you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, I would describe a formal mentorship as, you know, a person or a program that, that, where you''re assigned a mentor, um, like, "Hey, this person''s gonna show you the ropes and all of that." I think an informal mentorship is where maybe you haven''t defined it as clearly with that other person. Um, it''s, it''s literally just someone that you look up to who has more experience than you that you, uh, want to learn from and maybe even be like, and I definitely have those people, um, at my current workplace, as well as outside of the workplace. Um, I have those people I can just go to with career questions or more immediate, like, challenges that I''m facing with my team. Um, so, yeah, I, it''s never, like, I feel like it''s really awkward to (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To go to someone or to know someone and be like, "Hello and dear sir or madame."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>"Would you like to be my mentor?" (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Have, have you ever done that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>I have not. I''ve never, yeah, I just can''t do it. It just feels so awkward. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Has anybody ever done that to you? Like, have you ever gotten an email that says, from somebody saying, like, "Alisha, can you by my mentor?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nNo, I haven''t. I''ve, I''ve participated. I''ve signed up for mentorship programs where it''s usually alumni programs, uh, from my college where you just sign up to be a mentor, um, but those have also been kind of awkward and stilted. Like, you schedule a Skype call and you just chat, and I don''t know. It, it hasn''t really worked out well yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, gotcha.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, and I wonder if anybody else has figured out a way to make it a little more formal, but more successful, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, that''s what this podcast is here for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure that out. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wh-what about internships? How does an, how does an internship fit into the whole model of apprenticeship and learning and, and, um, excuse me, mentorship and learning and all of that kind of stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think internships are amazing. Um, I personally have had one every summer during college, and I learned so much. Um, I think going back to our hard skills versus soft skills conversation, I don''t think I learned, um, hard skills during internships that, you know, have helped me today, but what I have learned are really awesome soft skills. Um, like, I had one internship at a venture capital firm, um, I think sophomore year, after my sophomore year of college, and that just helped me, uh, learn how to work in like a really high-pressure environment with a very small team and just how to get things done when things are down to the wire, um, so it''s just things like that. I don''t think I have any hard skills, but I think they''re still valuable, um, for learning just how, how businesses work and how companies and people work in general.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do you have interns at Vox?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>We, I personally do not have interns, but we do have interns, um, in the design org.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>How, if you did have an intern, how would you want them to work with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nI would want them to be like a real member of the team, um.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>What does, what does that mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, I would want them to contribute to the real work. (laughs) Like the real, the real outputs. Um, first, cuz we really need the extra (laughs)-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>The extra hand-</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Sure.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>And the help. Um, I, I don''t think an internship would be, like, valuable to anyone if, if they''re kind of just doing, like, busy work or side work. Um, I think it would be valuable for both parties if, if that person was contributing to something, and at the end of their internship, they could say, "Hey, like, I helped design and ship this really awesome feature."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Do, do you think that''s too much pressure for an intern?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s a good question. I think it depends on how you manage the internship. I think with enough, um, enough organization and kind of scoping things down to a level, uh, where a beginner or, or a junior designer or junior product designer can handle. I think that''s great. I definitely wouldn''t expect an intern to be, like, able to solve, you know, how (laughs), how can we solve, um, messaging-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Across all of our platforms. Go. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>A certain problem has to be kind of bite-sized enough that-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Ex, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s like a little bit out of their reach, but not quite-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You know, still attainable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Exactly. Like, bite-sized, but it still has an impact and, uh, it will still get shipped at the end of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>There''s one more thing I want to kind of come back to, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is really, is I''m very curious about. You mentioned, you said, "Well, I was really lucky in that I had an Internet connection." Right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And, f-, just in that itself, one, I think that''s an interesting thought, that, like, uh, access is fortunate, is, is, is a form of fortune, you know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It''s not like something we could take for granted. The, the other thing about that is I hear that sentiment a lot from almost everyone I talked to about how they got into doing design or tech or any of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nYou know, I, I feel the same way, and I talk about it the same way. I''m like, "I''m really lucky because I had a cousin that just happened to drop off Photoshop one day and said, Hey-"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>"You should poke around with this, you know."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>And I feel like that''s a fairly common story. What role does luck play in all of this stuff with, like, learning and awareness and all the things that you kind of wrote about in those articles?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Well, I, I wish luck didn''t play a big part of it, but I think it did. Like, looking back, and not to get super, uh, mushy or emotional.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>But looking back, um, everything had to do with luck and access and just being somewhere at the right time and being exposed to something at the right time. Um, I, I don''t think I''ve ever talked about this with anyone, but I think one of the most, like, life changing things that''s happened to me is actually being able to attend the college that I attended. I went to Harvard, and it''s, it sounds like if you don''t know my back story, it''s just like, oh, yeah, like, whatever, like you went to an ivy league school. Cool. But, like, knowing my own history and my background, like, I didn''t grow up with a lot of money. Like, both my parents are first generation immigrants. Um, they don''t speak English very well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou know, it wasn''t, everything about my circumstance and surroundings should have led me to a college that''s like opposite of Harvard. (laughs) Um, but the fact that I had an Internet connection actually helped me understand that, hey, like, there''s a wider world out there and there are these really great colleges that I had never heard of until now, um, because I have the Internet and, um, I, I went on a bunch of weird college forums-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>To figure, figure that stuff out and figure out, like, how do I apply to a college, like, what do I need? Because my parents didn''t know that and they didn''t know how to, you know, guide me through that, and it was, it just changed my life. Like, it opened so many doors and opportunities.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Including where I''m at now, so yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s amazing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I-I, I''m gonna, I''m gonna dig into your back story a little bit more here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>I know that you, you, uh, you send out a newsletter, uh, ever so, ever so frequently.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>About being, about being mixed race.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Mm-hmm (affirmative).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, what, how, what role does that play in learning and jobs and mentorship and, and all that stuff? How does that affect your work and how do you think that affects sort of the future of tech?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Eww, that''s a (laughs)-, that''s a great (laughs).\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Just a small question for you. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>No, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too.”\r\n<br>br>\r\nNo, that''s a great question. Um, I think that, that''s a wonderful question. I think that it''s hard for me to un-link the idea of diversity and identity and mentorship. Um, those are all really, really closely linked for me, um, because I think if mentorship means having someone or people that you want to be like or look up to, like, what happens when you don''t see yourself reflected in the leadership of your company or the leadership of your entire field. Um, so, it certainly helps to see someone from a similar background, whether it''s like they''re a woman or a person of color or a mixed-race woman (laughs), excelling in your field cuz it says to you, like, "Hey, they did it, and maybe I can do it, too."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so awesome. Well, as we round out, last words of advice for people that are interested in either learning or teaching, what, what, what would you, what advice would you give them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>In learning or teaching?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Somebody who wants to learn tech or design or somebody who is like, "I have stuff that I can teach, but I don''t know who to teach or where to find them." What, what should those people do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I would say for teaching, there are so many wonderful programs out there, um, particularly those that, uh, focus on maybe underrepresented communities in tech, like Girls Who Code, Code 2040. Um, there are so many out there. I would encourage you to look into those and just find a community that you want to help out the most and get in touch cuz they''re always looking for volunteers to teach over a weekend or over a few weeks. Um, and in terms of, you know, wanting to learn, I think that, I read this amazing article, um, on HBR. It''s called ... This is more specifically talking to women who want to learn. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Okay. Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the title is Women are Over-Mentored, But Under-Sponsored.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>\r\nAnd I, yeah. I, I read that article, and I was like, "Oh, my God. This is, like, truth bombs all around." (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs) Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Um, the, the, the main focus of the article is that, you know, a lot of companies have mentorship programs. A lot of women have mentors. Women are being mentored to death, but, you know, what are your goals really in wanting your mentorship? Usually it''s career advancement and the fact that you want a promotion, um, or anything, anything like that, so it''s, it might be better to, instead of finding a mentor to find a sponsor.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s super interesting. Wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. And, and in the past few years ... Uh, this article came out a few years ago, and I read it at first, and I was like, "Oh, okay," and, like, nodded my head. And now that I reread it, looking back at my experiences, I''m like, "Yes, this is so true." Um, you really should kind of find someone higher up in your organization, um, who can guide you and, uh, fight for you for a promotion or, like, a really awesome opportunity or an assignment that''ll give you more visibility, um, cuz there, there really is a gender difference. Like, women and men, they both have mentors, but I think this study found that men tend to have more senior mentors that directly translate into promotions and advancement, more so than women, and that''s just fascinating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>It really is. That''s crazy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. Yeah. Especially when you look at all these, um, like, I know a place like Goldman Sachs and a lot of large companies have mentorship programs specifically designed for women, but it''s like, you know, is that really what women need? Maybe they need something, uh, that translates into something more real. (laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s interesting. Well, I''ll definitely check out those articles and link them up. Um, this is great, Alisha. Thank you so much for doing this. Uh, I guess the last question for you is if people want to get in touch with you, say hello, say, "Hey, I''m, I''m like you. Help me out."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>(laughs)\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Uh, where, where can they do that? How can they do that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Yes. Um, please tweet at me. (laughs) Uh, my han-, Twitter handle''s Alishalisha. You can also email me. Uh, ramos.alisha@gmail, and I''m always happy to chat.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Alisha, thank you so much. Uh, this has been awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Alisha </dt>\r\n<dd>Of course. Thank you, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

(2814, 271, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall.

How are you doing?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nPretty good.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn''t have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here''s where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn''t have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn''t even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What''s your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn''t be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I''d been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it''s clear, and then we''ll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I''d say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn''t doing it for everybody. It wasn''t clear enough. It wasn''t actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it''s largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It''s super good." I''m sure in a year we''ll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It''s so much better than anything I could have done on my own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s where we''re at right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat kind of things weren''t working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSome examples. I''ll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn''t really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It''s not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they''re doing a good job, and I think it''s hard to know from a Doc like that that you''re doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here''s the mid level role and here''s the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. It''s interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they''re doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they''re doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they''re doing a bad job?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we''re like, "Hey, you''re not living up to this part of the role. We''re going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It''s really helpful. Again, I''ve been in situations where I''ve felt like somebody wasn''t doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn''t able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it''s not the same as being able to point to something that we''ve all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn''t have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you''re not making it up. You''re not changing the bar. You''re not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you''re both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn''t been happening. Let''s talk about that." As opposed to, "You''re not writing code," and the designer''s like, "Well, I didn''t know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It''s actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it''s not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed''s design roles, and I know you''ve written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMaking these public, there''s probably a 2-part answer to why we think that''s important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it''s a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that''s really important. I think it''s really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it''s a good thing. It''s management''s version of open source.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere was no such thing. That''s the second reason. That''s why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it''s taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it''s probably one of the more ... It''s not the most important thing, but it''s really important. If you have bad management or people who don''t know how to do it or whatever and they''re not supportive, you''re going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that''s happened, and that''s awesome. That''s great. I''m hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that''s a really great thing to have in the world. I don''t understand why more people don''t share those. There''s no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We''re not changing the world here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI''m going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we''ll see, but we''ll go with it. You said it''s like management''s version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they''ve forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that''s a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe''ve talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven''t gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we''ve been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we''re just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don''t want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren''t a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t state a community manager just for that particular thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think so. Those aren''t the only Docs we''ve put out in the public either. We''re going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we''re able to have now, but it''s definitely come up.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what''s IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you''re not managing people directly. That''s one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What''s interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There''s no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI think that would make sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nBut I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that''s the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person''s not a good manager and he''s miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that''s a huge bummer, so what we''ve done is we parallelized the tracks, so that''s why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThen M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we''d obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What''s funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they''re managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people''s design work and stuff and impact that. I think it''s really cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nTotally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt should be in the same Doc, or if it''s not, that''s my bad and we need to add it in.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What''s the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC''s, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there''s a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we''re doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don''t know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC''s, I''ve found, is with a designer, it''s really clear what''s going on almost all the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person''s career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it''s a black box. I don''t know what''s happening in someone''s one on one. I''m not in the meeting with their other director level people that they''re in together. I''m not there so I don''t actually know what''s happening. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey walk out of a one on one and I''m not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can''t actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNew managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it''s hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you''re still holding on, you''re really in the work all the time, and you''re pissing off the designers. It''s totally what''s happening, so it''s really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I''m trying to buffer that so the designers don''t all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That''s a really tricky thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC''s or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSuccessful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they''ll have any conversation, they don''t care. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey''ll just go after it. They''re very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she''ll just try anything. If someone has an idea that''s not hers, she''ll just do it. Even if she thinks it''s totally wrong. She''ll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn''t work." Just zero ego. It''s super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don''t know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren''t a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that''s insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nManagers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI always get really nervous when someone''s concealing what they''re doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I''m going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it''s not going to be perfect. There''s going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it''s breaking or something''s not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I''ll never know and I''ll just think everything''s fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I''m sure it''s going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven''t yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI see.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nDoes that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don''t have any idea. They''re not even watching and they''re not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you''re ... Design''s the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I''d come with design work and I''d be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something''s wrong with it. I don''t know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something''s not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn''t have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn''t have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what''s going on with it, that''s a good thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, totally. I think people wish they didn''t have it, but I actually really trust people that do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that. I don''t think I''ve ever heard anybody say that. It''s really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let''s dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it''s your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you''re doing there and what you''re going to be doing there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I''ve been able to do things I don''t think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I''m responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I''m not sure they''re all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn''t exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where''s the logo?"\r\n<br><br>\r\nNo one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd that''s great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn''t able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don''t have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn''t know what that meant and now I totally know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nA year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I''m going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There''s a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We''re doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I''ve realized, at this point, that I''ve taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we''re most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team''s self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he''s built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we''re talking to them so much, all the time, and so I''m going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we''re moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWhich feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I''m really excited for them because it''s a really great change. It''ll actually, I think, empower them even more than they''ve been. It''ll be good. At the same time, like I said, I''m managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they''re starting to really lead the team as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we''re working on, and that''s not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That''s crazy, so these three people together know everything because they''re working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I''m starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that''s, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJust heckle and throw eggs and stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I''m in this weird moment where I don''t really know what''s next for me internally, and it''s something I''m talking about with my manager. I''ve been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nStay turned. I''m sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you fear that at all? Do you think there''s one day you''re going to be like, "There''s nothing left for me to do."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name''s Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She''s very literal. She''s a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can''t do that, right?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "Yes, I know. I''m just kidding." I don''t know. I''m not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You''re really great at making yourself not indispensable. You''re really good at planting yourself obsolete."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nShe was saying that, it''s like a compliment. It''s a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It''s like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I''m setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn''t matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It''s not my team. It''s BuzzFeed''s team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I''m not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don''t talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don''t worry too much about it as long as I feel like I''m doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I''m responsible for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so awesome. It''s very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You''re taking the opposite approach.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn''t have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn''t have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who''s really good at that stuff? It''s Cap." She pinged me one night and she''s like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I''ve taken that on, and I''ve been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it''s opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt doesn''t have to be even design related. I''m excited to figure out what other stuff I''m able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That''s why I''m probably talking about it so much right now, where I''m like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He''s a great design manager, but I don''t feel like-" ... I don''t think that''s right. I think it''s just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure what''s next, but I don''t really fear it too much.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you''ve got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s vital. I think like measuring, people don''t put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It''s funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn''t matter if it''s on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I''ll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn''t really pay attention to the language, it wouldn''t be effective. It probably wouldn''t be clear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think there''s a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they''re doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that''s not going to take hold as much as if you have something you''re referring back to constantly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRefer to these documents a lot?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle''s Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we''re using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that''s the person I don''t want to be so bad.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 2006, I recall that I said-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI trademark it myself. Terrible.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nLast topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here''s the way it is," and that''s not actually accurate, but it''s the way that you want it to be, so you''re setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it''s really hard to hire good people, but also, if you''re the one trying to be hired, it''s really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think hiring great people, I think people think it''s hard. I don''t find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It''s funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It''s just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don''t know. I do not find that difficult. I think there''s a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn''t use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they''d send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey weren''t in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there''s no way it''s not the recruiter''s fault. It''s a sniff test for, as a designer, I''m like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It''s these weird things that people won''t think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who''s in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn''t really know about product design at Etsy and didn''t know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that''s why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I''m getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It''s weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that''s why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that''s actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you''ll find people who want to work that way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you''re trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn''t know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That''s been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don''t know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that''s okay. I don''t think I''ve ever hired anybody out of that. I don''t think anybody''s ever looked for a job that way so far. I don''t know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don''t post job listings for design, so no one would even know we''re hiring, and so we reach out super ... It''s all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy don''t you post job postings?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you''re talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s like just doing the math about what''s the most effective for us. I don''t know if that''s right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere''s this interesting thing that I''ve noticed with it, and I think you''d probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they''re not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we''re having problems with diversity. We''re working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You''re like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it''s up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that''s not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think that''s really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don''t know. It''s not something I think we''re super conscious of all the time, but it''s definitely there in the background. There''s a background process ring where you''re like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that''s probably a good thing in the end.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don''t mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t if I''d say everything to get email about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nKind of an oxymoron.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know. Every once in a while I''ll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It''s funny. I don''t write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I''m writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It''s my thought process that I''m going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it''s really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don''t know. I get random emails from people. They''re like, "I''m coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It''s cool to me how their designers are like ... I''ve met designers that are all over the career pathway where they''re just starting out. I met someone the other day who''s transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that''s been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn''t normally meet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. We''re can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy website has my email address on it so it''s just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Thanks for having me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMy pleasure. Take it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We''ve done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we''ve been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we''ve gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we''ve got better ideas." Or, "We''ve got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe had been doing internships and we''d been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it''s a fairly new idea. When I got back, I''d asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let''s just try it, let''s just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Now you had mentioned there''s a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you''d kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let''s go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don''t know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What''s the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it''s something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what''s coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let''s say you''re a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that''s like, or in some cases if you''re in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you''re taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you''re creating.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason why it''s different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let''s have this person here for a short amount of time while they''re doing this thing." It''s almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you''re putting you''re time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThe selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we''ve been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they''re trying to get out of the program. We''ll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we''ll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they''re going to work on things that we challenge them with. We''re going to provide them with a product, we''re going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe''re going to assess them across different criteria. We''re going to look at their actual work, so if they''re designers we''re going to look at their design skills. If they''re developers we''re going to look at that. If they''re a combination we''re going to look at both. What we''re also secretly doing is we''re seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it''s like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We''re looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we''ll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we''ve got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they''ll go through that, the 15 week program.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It sounds like you''re looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you''re looking for cues that they''re going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThey''re the same. We''re looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we''re definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We''re looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can''t necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture''s different that, but that''s something that we have no control over.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don''t?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we''re in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We''re actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we''re starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We''re like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn''t have let all of them go and find other jobs." We''re pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They''re part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that''s one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nIn the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn''t it work for apprenticeships too.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. They''ve gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who''s who, it''s amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that''s a pretty strong group of people\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, that''s amazing. What kind of person doesn''t make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you''re like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who''s designing a digital product. We''re looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they''re unable to communicate it effectively, or they''re unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don''t work well in teams and they don''t collaborate well. Those are the things that we''ve identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we''ve grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they''ve gone on to get into serious relationships, they''re married, they''ve got kids, their lives are changing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust by the nature of the fact that they''re aging, they''re also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there''s always good talent that''s coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn''t just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We''re just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you''re growing then you''re probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I think initially we probably weren''t doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren''t really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we''re now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you''re not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you''re still about to carry those skills with you. That''s been one big change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you''re in the crucible, you''re with the client, you''re dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there''s no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we''re paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they''re working on client project then they''re billable, and if they''re billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it''s certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe''re 100% transparent about it, and because we''re transitioning them into projects where there''s already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We''re not saying, "Hey, I know you''ve been working with this person who''s senior and skilled, and we''re replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We''re saying, "We''re going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they''re doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we''re amplifying the work we''re also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what''s your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''ve some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they''re doing. Then, I''m also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you''re the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it''s amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they''ll decide what they want to do, they''ll go and study it, and then from then on it''s just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there''s a very good chance that it''ll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it''s very emotional, but once you''ve got through that stage it''s so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don''t have to go to job boards to find a job. I don''t have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I''m definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I''m going to go an reach out to them. I''m going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we''re giving them a skill that they''ll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man, I''m getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI think I said at the beginning that we''re designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we''re working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don''t really care so much about which industries we''re working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they''re trying to solve, or problem they''re trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we''re not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice, and you''re in the Boston area right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, we''re about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We''re just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it''s just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn''t matter what it is, I''m going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we''ve had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don''t think location matters as much. I think people, because that''s a paid apprenticeship, they''re willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I''d say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat''s hard, it''s really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it''s incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it''s also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That''s really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we''re pursuing that, and hopefully one day we''ll even be successful at actually doing that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAmazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI love conversation that''s challenging, and I love these topics that we''ve been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it''s value pricing, or the education stuff that we''ve just been mentioning, whether it''s culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that''s the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I''m going to respond to.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nOn Twitter I''m RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there''s two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I''m afrotrash.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRichard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAll right, talk to you soon.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nChow.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

Can you talk a little bit about that, and tell us about what that looked like, and what that experience was like for you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, definitely. I''m happy to do that. For me, a definitely interesting approach. I was asked a lot when you''re first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn''t. My response to that normally was, "Didn''t go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nKnowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You''re going to need to run Windows for this course."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn''t have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat was the criteria?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThe criteria, there really wasn''t. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn''t something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn''t know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nIt was small, small pool. You''re right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I''ve done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we''re talking I had Photoshop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI had a couple books.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou had a Macbook.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn''t just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can''t completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSorry. Did you say that it was not paid?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. The internship was not paid.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I''m not being paid, but they''re investing time and resources into me. I''m not paying for college classes right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn''t have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don''t have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you''re reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let''s see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You''re writing actual code. You''re working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here''s my design. What do you think? It''s cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here''s the design, what do you think about it? Here''s why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I''d say 70% dedicated to web, but it''s college age. You''re trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nActually, both of them did teach part-time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. There''s a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It''s not a state school. It''s a smaller private school. I''m getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There''s a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren''t. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren''t teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. What happens next in the story? You''re working at a coffee shop. You''re going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we''re doing. When you''re learning, you''re not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren''t just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat was the first time ... Again, weren''t paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I''m not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you''re working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that''s the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you''ve got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nPretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven''t changed what I''ve done for about six years. Hopefully, I''m a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I''m doing what I like. It''s fun.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nOne thing we didn''t talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nEven simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don''t work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We''re a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. Now, do you have interns? If you don''t, one day do you think you will?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nDefinitely. I don''t right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I''m about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that''s inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn''t see any other options.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, it''s pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you''re doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there''s cheap labor in there too, but there''s got to be something more than that, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren''t going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can''t promise that that''s the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone''s interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThanks. You too, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

(2878, 275, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I''m fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We''re trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It''s with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it''s just aarron ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... and my website is <a href=" aarronwalter.com">aarronwalter.com</a>, so ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, thank you!\r\n</dd>'),

(2894, 276, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJervis, one of the things that has always stuck with me from you is you gave me this tip once, you said, "When you''re teaching, never put your hands on the keyboard."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight? Can you talk about that? Where does that come from? Why is that important to you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nIf you''re a teacher and a student''s sitting at a computer and you put your hands on the keyboard, you''re taking control away from the student and they''re becoming the observer. They''re not the participant, really. The philosophy is basically, if you don''t touch the keyboard and you articulate to the student what you need them to type and they actually have their fingers and doing the motion, I think it''s a better learning experience for them. Because there''s many a time, someone will show me something and they take the keyboard and I''m just watching what they do on the screen. It doesn''t have the same effect as me typing it. Whether it be muscle memory or just the experience of typing that information myself and making the mistakes, makes it a better experience for the learner.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, I got you. You''re pretty strict about that too. I know that when I was learning from you, when I was in school, you would never ever touch the keyboard, right? You stay away.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I try to avoid it all cost. Sometimes you have to probably break. You only have five minutes per student and it may be something that''s just quicker to press the key for them just one time but I try to avoid it all cost. I rather the student just use the keyboard or the mouse or whatever technology it is and have them experience it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s pretty a die hard rule but every once in a while, I may have to say, "All right, hit the Enter. No, the enter button. Okay."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRight. That''s awesome. That has always stuck with me. It''s such a small thing but every time I''m trying to show someone something, I make sure I''m backed up. I''m not like, "Oh let me just do it, let me just do it." Because it''s so easy to do that just like, "Oh no, I got it. Let me show you."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI think it makes you a better teacher too because you have to articulate what you want them to do so you can''t just say, "Right there." You got to give them a line number. Look at the end of the line of code. Work your way backwards. All your variables named correctly. Check your case. Rather than you just typing it, none of that is articulated.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting. The way that you and I met was when I was in school, you were a professor at Drexel. You''re still a professor at Drexel and I learned a ton of stuff from you, programming, Flash, HTML, all sorts of stuff. I consider you one of my mentors. I feel like I can still go to you for advice. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you''re doing now. Are you still at Drexel? What are you teaching? Who are you teaching? Things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSure. I am a fulltime teaching professor in the interactive digital media program at Drexel University. I''ve been there since 99.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s a long time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Loving every minute of it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJust so the audience knows, you came in your freshman year and I met in a freshman talk where I got to introduce myself to the freshman class. One of the few students to come up after ... Because you know freshman year, everybody''s pretty shy but Daniel Mall came up right after the talk and asked me 3 questions. That was you. That was my first recollection of meeting you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat did I ask you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know the exact question. It wasn''t 1. It wasn''t 2. It was 3.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s funny. Wow. I don''t even remember that. What stuff were you teaching when you started in 99? What stuff are you teaching now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 99, it was a little bit of HTML. Actually when I started, it was Director. Director was the number 1 interactive multimedia tool next to writing code. CD-ROM development was king because the web wasn''t too popular too fast. There was not broadband. There was frame relay with very slow internet speeds. If you wanted to get a client or a customer anything over 10 megs, you had to pretty much burn a CD and send it through FedEx overnight. It was Director, a little bit of HTML before the editors came. After Director, it was the rise of Flash with ActionScript 1. Then from Flash ActionScript 2 and then 3. After Flash had its heyday which was a pretty long run almost 10 years, it started to face out when in 2007 when the iPhone came out and people started to realize that Flash was just a little bit to bulky to run on mobile devices. Then the switch went to HTML5 which is where it''s currently at right now in addition to Unity, which is the number 1 3D and then now 2D multimedia offering tool because it can run on so many platforms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt still require a plug-in for desktops and notebooks and it won''t run on mobile devices. If you want to do mobile, the king of the hill right now is HTML5, CS-X3, JavaScript and all their components.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow do you know how to teach all that stuff? You started with Director and then moving into Flash and HTML and Unity. Those are all different things. How do you keep up to date? Do you have to keep learning those things? How are you able to learn them so well that you can teach them to students?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause I am a geek at heart. I love technology. I like to get all the toys. Back in the day when I was in the Air Force, I had the Casio watch that had the calculator and the address book in it. Every since then whenever I had the money, I would buy the new technology. For me, it''s all play. I love to keep up on the emerging technologies like the MYO, the Leap, Google Glasses and the variations thereof. For me, my spare time is meant just picking up new technologies and playing with them because I can justify it now as part of my job.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBusiness expense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I love to learn. For me, it''s not so much of a job picking up these new technologies and learning how to use them as much as a joy. For me to explain it in a classroom, I have to get familiar with it. I have to try it out. That makes it all the better.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you feel like there are certain things that you can''t learn?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nCan''t learn. That''s very debatable. Yes. I am more a technical programmer. There''s an art form to writing code or writing them officially and solving problems but I do not consider myself to be a creative artist. I am not a designer by trade but I can see when things are designed well. For me to use Photoshop and Illustrator like some of you guys do, guys and gals do out in the field, I''m a little bit jealous but that''s one thing I can''t do or I''m not able to put in the time and effort at this stage to become super duper proficient in it because my time is I think better spent on the code. To answer you question, I don''t think I''m a creative artist but I am a code artist.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat about code? Do you think there are certain pieces of code that are passed you? Do you feel like you can pick up any piece of code out there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOh yeah. Given enough time, I think I can pick up just about any piece of code ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat''s the key then? Because you''ve taught all sorts of different languages and as new languages come out, you seem to be on top of them. For somebody that''s like, "I only HTML but I don''t feel like I could learn iOS or Swift or something like that," how would you go about teaching somebody something like that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. HTML is more structure language but for example JavaScript or back in the day Lingo or Python, the key in my opinion is that languages are all syntax. With the power of Google, you can always look up the syntax. Once you understand the basics, once you understand what a variable is and how it holds information, once you understand how an array is and how it host multiple pieces of information, once you know what an if statement or a switch statement or a conditional statement is set up, it''s pretty much the same in any language. The basics are variables. You got your input, whether it be keyboard, mouse, a MYO, a touchscreen. You have your conditional statements. The if end statement, a switch. Case statements. You have your looping. You have 4 loops, wild loops. Then you have our output, whatever that output may be whether it''s a screen or speaker, touch sensitive material, whatever that maybe. Once you understand those basics, the syntax you can just look up. For example, in Unity, there''s 3 languages. There''s C sharp.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere''s JavaScript and my favorite language even though I haven''t used it that much, Boom, which is a language in Unity. If a student needs to do something or I need to do something, I plan out the logic, the pseudo code behind it and then I just look up the syntax to achieve that logic or that pseudo code.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean when you say pseudo code?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPseudo code is like an English like way of describing the problem. You write that code in something that you''re comfortable with. Lingo, which was a language back in the day, is very similar to that. You would write out, "This variable is going to be equal to a value and then I''m going to run a loop. I''m just going to write out whatever I''m comfortable writing as far as a loop is concerned. Not worry about syntax." Then from that pseudo semi coded language that I understand personally, I can then look up the syntax to write it in any one particular language.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. How did you get started doing all this stuff?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWow. Back in the day ... Speaking of mentors, one of my mentors got me into this one. Big brother John, you know I got to bring him up because he got me into this. When I was 13 years old, this was 1977, my big brother worked at Columbus University on their mainframe because in 77, PCs did not exist. Back in 77 if you wanted to play a game, you had to go to an arcade with a bunch of quarters and put your quarter in the machine to play Asteroids of Defender or whatever the case may be. My brother, when was I was 13, brought me up to Columbus. On the mainframe, I got to play this Asteroid game on the keyboard on this little screen. The mainframe took up the entire wall and I got to play Asteroids for free on this thing called a mainframe computer. Since then, I was hooked. I was always interested in it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFrom there, when I got into high school, when I was a junior, this was 1980, they had a class where you could actually learn how to write FORTRAN code on the same mainframe they used in the high school. You had to do it on punch cards. I did like that but I like to solve problems. I like to figure stuff out. That''s how I got into the programming aspect of it. From there, I went to school for computer science. After 5 different universities, I ... Because I was in the Air Force so I traveled around a lot. I went from 1 university to another. I finally finished my degree at Drexel in 99. Once again, my brother convinced me to finish my time in the Air Force and go to Drexel and get my degree in what was then information science technology because there was no digital media degree back in 95, 96, 96. I went to Drexel in 97. Got out of the Air Force in 96. Went to Drexel 97. Got my IST degree in 99.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were impressed with my teaching experience in the Air Force because I was a master training instructor in the Air Force. Teaching programming, FORTRAN, Unix, networking, all that fun stuff. They said, "Hey, you want to teach in this new program we''re going to start called digital media?" This was in 99. I taught a summer class. Graduated in June. Taught a summer class that summer and started teaching September of the same year, this new program called digital media. It was me and Glenn Muscho.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nFrom there while I was at Drexel, I was actually working at a multimedia company called EP Design which does a lot of, back then, CD-ROM development, now web and learning management systems and training for government agencies and some medical companies. While I was teaching, I was also working at EP Design. I got to practice what I was learning in IST with EP Design doing CD-ROMs and working Director and burning a whole bunch of CDS for clients and learning how to use multimedia. It went hand-in-hand what I was learning in school, I got to do at the job. What I did at the job, I got to help me out with school. By the time I graduated in 99, they offered me the teaching as an adjunct. The company offered me a silent partnership because they didn''t want to lose me. I''ve been doing both ever since just learning as I go.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow important do you think that is because there''s that whole age old saying about those who can''t teach? As long as I''ve known you and as you''ve said longer than that, you''ve both been teaching as well as working. Do you think that''s important for teachers or do you think some people can be successful teachers without doing the application stuff? How important do you think that split is?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy personal opinion is you can''t do one without the other.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy''s that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nBecause yeah, you can read the instructions out of the book but unless you have experience with the actual language or with the actual technology, it''s hard to explain to somebody who doesn''t. One of the reasons I enjoy teaching is because in order for me to explain something well to somebody who doesn''t understand it, I have to become that much more familiar with it. I have to have ... In my opinion, in order to be a good teacher, you got to be involved in the technology you''re teaching. You got to be invested in it. Have some background information because there''s some nuances that you just won''t read in the book.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nPut you on the spot here but can you think of any examples of that in action?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nAll right. When I was in the Air Force, we went to master training school. Yeah. Master training school where you learned to become an instructor. One of their philosophies is once you put on the instructor badge, you can teach just about anything. You don''t have to have a working experience or working knowledge in it. However, as a student while I was going in that training as to become the instructor, they would have exercises where you would teach. You would get a lesson plan and you would have to teach something that you''re not familiar with. For example, I''m into programming and then I would get to teach or get a lesson plan for jet engines.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man. That''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMe personally, I find that very confusing because yeah, I could read the bullet points in the lesson plan. I could articulate what was in there but as soon as the student asked me something that wasn''t in the lesson plan, lesson covered in the book, I didn''t know. I would have to say, "Well, let me research that and get back to you." That''s where the experiences ... If an engineer or a mechanic was teaching that class and actually worked on that jet engine for 3 or 4 years, they would know an abundance of information that I just wasn''t familiar with because it wasn''t in the lesson plan.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What are some other things that you think make for a good teachers? Do you see some themes across good teachers and say bad teachers that you would say, "I think good teachers have these things down or have these approaches?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhen you have teachers that are more effective, I don''t want to say there are bad teachers because that''s politically incorrect.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome teachers that are more effective on certain students because different students gravitate towards different teachers depending on their style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nSome students can''t stand me as a teacher because I''m too strict or I''m not fair and so on and so forth. My ground rules, some students they gravitate and say, "Hey, he''s a good teacher. I had learned a lot from what he covers in the classroom." Just depends on the teacher style and the learning style.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nMy rules are you got to grade strict but fair. You can''t take off points for 1 student for being late and then another student comes in late, you don''t take off points. You got to be strict but fair because if you''re too nicey nice, the students will take advantage of you. I always try to identify the student''s learning style. Some students learn better by reading it in the book. Some students learn better by actually doing it in the classrooms. Some students learn by you walking them through the process. There''s some students that learn better by you challenging them and not telling them anything other than it can be done. Once you understand the learning style of the student and you covered the basic material and you''re sitting down with them one-on-one in a lab, you have a better effect if you approach their learning style versus what you''re comfortable teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nOne you already know about, never touch the keyboard if you can avoid. Help students that need help and challenge students that don''t. If you have a classroom full of students and maybe half of them need help, that''s why I like to do labs, sit down with them one-on-one. The students that already know the material or are comfortable with the material, I usually give them extra curricular activities to do, extra challenge or extra credit, tasks for them to try and complete so they''re not bored sitting in the classroom.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t let anybody coast?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo. You know that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI do but what ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I don''t coast because especially at the college level, because when they graduate, they''re out in the real world. You don''t want to get fired from your job because you skated through college. Yeah, you got the B''s and the C''s and you got your degree but when you sit down at that desk or sit down in front of that computer and they actually want you to create something, and you''re lost and somebody has to hold your hand the whole way through.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t like cutting any slack. They don''t like it but I''ve had many student come back after they graduate and say, "I''m glad you were so hard on me because I had to learn and be adaptive and so on and so forth."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I could certainly identify with that. What about the other side of the coin? What makes for good students? Maybe that''s a politically incorrect thing too. Maybe there are no bad or good students. What makes for an effective student?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI know bad students. They have different rates of learning. They have different learning styles. Some students get it or get that light. That light goes on behind their eyes. Maybe their freshman year and maybe their sophomore year and maybe their junior and maybe even their senior year where they actually, "Oh. This is how I do stuff." Students that challenge themselves and don''t do the bare minimum, I''ve seen over the years are the most effective, are the most successful, like for yourself ... Yourself for example, freshman year you came up, 3 questions. Ever since then, you asked me questions. Freshman. Sophomore. Junior. Worked on special projects. Doing above and beyond the bare minimum. I can even remember the Flash final project you did with the ... It wasn''t just connect the dots. No. You had to solve a math problem in order to connect the dots in the right way. Students who push beyond the bare minimum usually are more successful than students that just do the bare minimum to get by. Sometimes that''s a maturity level thing. Sometimes that''s just getting familiar with college.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI also often tell my students that your career doesn''t start when you graduate. Your career actually starts your freshman year because that''s when you''re learning your skill set. That''s when you''re building your resume. That''s when your making the network connections. Some students get it that age but I remember being 18. I just wanted to be a stuntman and ride motorcycles. My maturity level didn''t hit until I was like 25, 27. To answer your question, yeah, there are no bad students. Some students get it sooner in life than others and they challenge themselves to do better. Some students, you know, college, I just want to party. They don''t get it until maybe ... Hopefully their sophomore year.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Got you. What about grad versus undergrad? I know you teach both. You teach both in the grad program as well as teaching in undergrad. What differences do you see between grad students and undergrads?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nGrad students come in with different undergrad degrees. If they''re going for digital media master''s, hopefully they come in with some background in computers and programming and basic fundamentals of digital media. The graduate level, I think this is across all universities, is more about theory. There''s less hands on. The undergraduate is more technical, theory, hands on application, trial and error. The graduate level, the way I at least teach it is, I give you the problem. We just talk about it. We discuss the theory how to best apply it like color theory or typography. Then the student has to figure out the technology for the most part by themselves to achieve that goal.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It''s more open-ended on the grad side?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYes. It''s more of a challenge on them because I''m not going to walk them through, at least officially, I can''t walk them through how to get a domain name and learn how to use FTP and upload files, so on and so forth because that''s more technical. Unofficially sometimes I help them out especially if they have an undergrad in history and they come into a digital media masters, they''re going to need a little bit of extra help to learn that technical foundation. I need to do that after class to get them up to speed. Usually by the end of the first quarter or the first half of the year, they''re up to speed.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Last question as we wrap up, a lot of what we''re talking about is the way that you teach and the way that you see things happening in the classroom. Do you also teach at your job? Do you at EP Design? Are teaching younger designers and developers, people that are still cutting their teeth? If you are, how different is the classroom setting versus the work setting in how you teach?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI did have a "under lane." Maybe he surpassed me in many ways now. Phil Sinatra. You may remember him.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPhil Sinatra works with me at EP Design. When he first started with EP Design, I was his mentor. He was my mentee. That is more like a one-on-one scenario in the classroom where in the classroom you have 15 students, 15 to 20 in my case. The lab time is when we get to sit down with them one-on-one and maybe 5, 10 minutes per student until time runs out or you make an appointment to have a meeting for an hour. With the mentorship, I got to spend a lot more time with Phil because we had 8 hours in the day. Once he got up to speed like now, he does things in HTML and CSX there. I''m like, "Wow. That''s pretty cool."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. What advice would you give to somebody? Probably the people listening to this are not teachers. At least not in higher ed setting but maybe they are set up at their jobs to be mentoring somebody or taking somebody under their wing. What advice could you give them as to what they should be paying attention to or what they could be doing for those people?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nI would recommend first care and identify with the new person because they''re not going to know everything that you know so don''t take it for granted. Be strict but fair. Say, "Hey, let me walk you through this process. I''m not going to walk you through it every time but the first or second time, I''m going to walk you through it and help you out." Be open to feedback because sometimes that new guy or the new gal may have a different approach that nobody ever considered before. Once again, don''t touch the keyboard. Praise their technical or creative or whatever their talent set is. Maybe they''re really good at writing but ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nPraise that because nobody is perfect at everything but if you can praise the things that they are talented on, then they''d be more likely to get better at the other stuff that is at their job. Because at their job is not all just 3D. It''s not all just web development. There''s other things. You''ve got emails. You''ve got correspondence. You got people you got to deal with in psychology of communication and public talks, so on and so forth. If you''re going to be a mentor in the job place, yeah, care about the person. Take time. Not just brush them off to the side and say, "Here. Do this. Do that." Walk them through the process. Ask them for feedback. Get a fresh set of eyes on whatever work structure or, excuse me, workflow that is going on because they may have some good feedback for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love it. Jervis, this is awesome. You''re awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nWhy thank you sir.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCan people ask you questions and email you and things like that? Would you open to that? What''s the best way for them to get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nJervo@jervo.com. J-E-R-V-O at J-E-R-V-O dot com.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. You''re on Twitter too, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYup. On Twitter and guess what? Jervo. J-E-R-V-O.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMaking it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nNo problem.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. Jervis, thank you so much for doing this. This is really great. I think people are going to get a lot out of this.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Jervis </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re very welcome, D Mall. Anytime.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

How are you doing?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nPretty good.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou wrote a couple of amazing things online, specifically to Google Docs, and I want to talk a little bit about that. I guess it was about a year, a year and a half go, you wrote a Google Doc when you started a BuzzFeed about design roles and product design roles, and you wrote a bunch of things there, and then about a year later, I guess maybe this is a couple weeks ago now, you got to a 2.0 of that document, and you made that public. Can you talk a little bit about those documents and what they were and what led you to write them?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. To be totally honest, one point on that Doc, I ripped off for myself at Etsy. The reason that Doc is important or the reason I started writing it in the first place at Etsy and then wound up transitioning it to BuzzFeed was we didn''t have career [tri 00:00:56] at Etsy. At Etsy, we had levels, but no real articulation of what those levels meant, and so it made it really hard to set goals with designers about here''s where you are with your skillset and here are the things you can do to level up, and also it made it hard for us as managers to find proper things that would help that person level up, things that would challenge those people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt BuzzFeed, the problem is they didn''t have that, but also the titles were all over the place because they didn''t even have the leveling system in place, so I would ask somebody, a designer, "What''s your role?" They would tell me, and I would be like, "Okay, cool. How do you get to the next level? What is the next level?" They wouldn''t be able to really tell me what it was even called, much less how to do it, so I literally copy and pasted the one that we had written for Etsy.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd then replaced Etsy with BuzzFeed, just made a couple, quick changes, things that I''d been thinking about, and sent it to the design team with comments turned on and was like, "Hey, check this out. Let me know if this reasonable, if it looks right, if it''s clear, and then we''ll have conversations about where everybody fits in and how to start setting goals and stuff." We did that a year and a half ago, and then I''d say, maybe six months ago, we went through this process of re-anchoring with the design team where we looked at the documents we were using and the processes we had in place and really reevaluated them to make sure that they were still right and good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt came up a few times that the rules document, which was better than nothing, which we had before, wasn''t doing it for everybody. It wasn''t clear enough. It wasn''t actionable enough. At this point, we have three design managers on the team, and I assigned them the task of rewriting it from scratch, and the three of them together came up with this amazing 2.0 Doc. I obviously gave them feedback along the way, but it''s largely their baby, and they launched it, and the designers are like, "It''s super good." I''m sure in a year we''ll be looking at everything like, "Ugh, we missed all this stuff," but it just feels so amazing. It''s so much better than anything I could have done on my own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s where we''re at right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat kind of things weren''t working from the original version? Maybe you have some examples you can share with that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSome examples. I''ll have to pull it up to look at it. I think the old one was just a bunch of bullet points. For instance, participates in our shared UX process or something like that was a bullet point. Sure, maybe, but it doesn''t really articulate to you the specific actions that you would need to take really. It''s not really verb driven, if that makes sense. Some people were confused about what that meant, and it was too nebulous. It was nebulous what you needed to do to even do your job well. Again, forget leveling up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think the goal of one of those documents, the primary goal, is to let people know that they''re doing a good job, and I think it''s hard to know from a Doc like that that you''re doing that or not, and so, again, we rewrote it and added a lot more clarity to it, and we actually wound up in the 2.0 Doc highlighting the differences in language between each level so you could really look at it side by side and be like, "Here''s the mid level role and here''s the senior role," and highlight it. We literally would copy and paste the description, but then we would change it and evolve it up the chain, and you could see it was highlighted so you could tell what was different about each level and what we thought was important about each one. It also made us super conscious of what those changes were.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nCool. It''s interesting to me to hear you articulate that a lot of the primary goal for that is to help people know if they''re doing a good job. Do you also use it for the opposite? Do you use those at all to let people know when they''re doing a bad job or for people to know on their own when they''re doing a bad job?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Definitely. We obviously do peer reviews and we do soft reviews and manager reviews of folks every six months or so, and then a part of that is actually going through it and being like, "Hey, this is-" ... There have been a few cases where we''re like, "Hey, you''re not living up to this part of the role. We''re going to try to help you achieve that stuff." It''s really helpful. Again, I''ve been in situations where I''ve felt like somebody wasn''t doing a good job, but as a manager, I wasn''t able to articulate why. I kind of knew and I could say a specific instance of a thing, but it''s not the same as being able to point to something that we''ve all agreed to as this is the thing we believe is true and the way we want to work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI didn''t have that artifact to point to in the past. Having this now makes it so much easier to have that conversation because you''re not making it up. You''re not changing the bar. You''re not moving the goalposts at all, and so you can have an honest conversation with a designer where you''re both looking at the same Doc that you both already know about and be like, "Hey, this says that this thing is supposed to be happening. It feels like it hasn''t been happening. Let''s talk about that." As opposed to, "You''re not writing code," and the designer''s like, "Well, I didn''t know I was supposed to be writing code. Does it say that anywhere?" It''s actually a lot easier, I think, to have those conversations.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s cool. One of the interesting things about this is that, and I guess this is something, for me, is very different than other organizations, is that you made both of these documents public, so it''s not just accessible to people at BuzzFeed or I guess Etsy, at the time, but anybody can view these, so I could just click the link to the Google Doc and I could look at BuzzFeed''s design roles, and I know you''ve written a little bit about transparency, too. Maybe talk a little bit about why transparency and making these kinds of things public are important for you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMaking these public, there''s probably a 2-part answer to why we think that''s important. I think the first one, it is very selfish, is it''s a good recruiting tool. Designers can look at that. They can know before they ever even talk to us or before they even know that they want to talk to us. They can look at this stuff and know what we think these roles are, and so that''s really important. I think it''s really helped us. It makes people know that we care about things being transparent, we care about sharing stuff with the community, and I think it''s a good thing. It''s management''s version of open source.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere was no such thing. That''s the second reason. That''s why I write about management a lot. I get this comment a lot, which is that very few people write and talk a lot about management, and I think it''s taken for granted as a practice sometimes in the industry, and I think it''s probably one of the more ... It''s not the most important thing, but it''s really important. If you have bad management or people who don''t know how to do it or whatever and they''re not supportive, you''re going to have a really bad time and the people on the team are going to have a really bad time, and so part of this is also just trying to contribute that back out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know people have taken it and, again, done what I did in the first place, which was copy and paste it and replace our BuzzFeed with their company, and I know that that''s happened, and that''s awesome. That''s great. I''m hoping they look at it and are critical of it and change stuff, but I think that that''s a really great thing to have in the world. I don''t understand why more people don''t share those. There''s no nuclear codes in there. It establishes visual design patterns. We''re not changing the world here.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI''m going to make a weird metaphor. This might break down, so we''ll see, but we''ll go with it. You said it''s like management''s version of open source, so what you just described is like if we compared this to GitHub. People have taken this and made it their own, so they''ve forked it or cloned it or whatever. Is there a version of this that''s a poll request? You see what other people are doing and then you merge it back in the way that BuzzFeed does design?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe''ve talked about it. The way we approach these things usually, we haven''t gotten there yet obviously, but I think the way we''ve been approaching it is this Doc is so super new for us and making sure that it works for us first before we open it up. Open and opening it so that other people can change it and stuff has been really important. We took a similar attack with this CSF framework that we made called Solid. We made a CSF framework. We wanted to put it out in the public. We wanted people to be able to use it, and the question came up of open source and we decided not to because we wanted ... The framework was for us and we''re just sharing it so people can learn from it and take it and do what they really want with it, but we don''t want to have to bear the burden of managing a community around it, if that makes sense.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are 13 people on our design team right now. There aren''t a ton of people with a ton of time on our hands to make sure that we are caring for that stuff in the best way right now, but it has come up a lot.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou don''t state a community manager just for that particular thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think so. Those aren''t the only Docs we''ve put out in the public either. We''re going to continue to put more stuff out there as we create it. If we started that down that path, I think we would need someone a little more dedicated than we''re able to have now, but it''s definitely come up.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. One of the things that jumps out at me in this document, this 2016 public design roles document, is that you have these little suffixes on each of the roles, IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, and I know this is probably something that other organizations do, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what''s IC. I know IC stands for individual contributor. What does that look like at BuzzFeed? What does that look like elsewhere? What is the counterpart to IC?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC tracks individual contributor basically means that you''re not managing people directly. That''s one of the biggest differences between that and the other track, which is what we call the M track, which is M3, M4, which is manager track. What''s interesting, I think, about those 2 things, management starts in at 3. There''s no junior manager right now on the design team anyway. My assumption has been you need a little bit of design experience before you become a manager probably.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI think that would make sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nBut I think a lot of companies, the problem is that a lot of people feel a lot of pressure to become a manager. They think that that''s the way to progress in their career, and you wind up doing things where the best designer on the team becomes a manager and all of a sudden 2 things happen. That person''s not a good manager and he''s miserable and the people around him are miserable, and also now, your best designer is not designing anymore, and that''s a huge bummer, so what we''ve done is we parallelized the tracks, so that''s why the IC numbers are actually even in there at all, is you get IC1, 2, 3, 4 and M3 and 4 to signal that these things are parallel. A senior designer, in terms of influence and skill at that role, is equivalent to a manager at the level, if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThen M4 and IC4 are the same. If we ever got past that where we are, we''d obviously add more levels, but we want people to feel like they can be a designer at BuzzFeed and not have to manage people directly. What''s funny about that is a lot of the IC3, IC4 things that we focus on with those folks are expanding their influence and influencing other people on the design team, influencing other product teams without specifically managing them, which I think actually in some ways is way harder probably, but they''re managing without managing, if that makes sense. They just get to avoid the one on ones and the annual reviews and stuff. They get to avoid the day to day grit of it, but they can engage in other people''s design work and stuff and impact that. I think it''s really cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nTotally. Do you have a Doc for the manager track, too?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt should be in the same Doc, or if it''s not, that''s my bad and we need to add it in.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. What''s the difference between how you train an IC and how you train an M?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThe IC''s, we focus a lot on hard skills and the earning levels, so 1 and 2 and actually even 3 at some point, there''s a lot of focus on hard skills, so design work, actual UX process field we''re doing, process, and then obviously some soft skills as you get hired into IC3, IC4. Management stuff, this is my first job managing managers, which has been an adventure in figuring out what you just asked me. I don''t know. My approach so far has been to try to instill principles, like principle decision making, into those people. The difference between managing managers and IC''s, I''ve found, is with a designer, it''s really clear what''s going on almost all the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou can look at the work. You can drop by their desk. You can be in a meeting and hear them describe the work. You are there as a manager for very critical moments in that person''s career, and you can guide them and give them feedback, very direct. The problem with managers is it''s a black box. I don''t know what''s happening in someone''s one on one. I''m not in the meeting with their other director level people that they''re in together. I''m not there so I don''t actually know what''s happening. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey walk out of a one on one and I''m not sitting there going like, "Well, I mean, I might have done this instead." I can''t actually do that, which has been a challenge and so I think when I finally figure it out is like trying to give them principles and instill in them ways of thinking, ways of managing, and hoping that that trickles through. You know what I mean? Hopefully, that is the thing that trickles through into their interactions with other people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. That seems like a really difficult thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNew managers, especially, are really tricky, I think. I remember being a new manager, too, and it''s hard. Your first year is trying to figure out how to let go of the work. Your whole first year, you''re still holding on, you''re really in the work all the time, and you''re pissing off the designers. It''s totally what''s happening, so it''s really tricky because you have to go through that pain to get out of it, but as the person managing that manager, I''m trying to buffer that so the designers don''t all get too ticked and that managers get too frustrated. That''s a really tricky thing to do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Do you find any patterns that you see among successful IC''s or successful managers? Is there a personality type that gravitates more toward one or the other? What kind of things do we see in there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSuccessful designers typically tend, for me, tend to be generalists and not even just in the design tool sense, but they will tackle any problem, they''ll have any conversation, they don''t care. You know what I mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThey''ll just go after it. They''re very fast. They have no ego about their work. That tends to make a really successful designer. One of the times at BuzzFeed, one of our more senior folks, she''ll just try anything. If someone has an idea that''s not hers, she''ll just do it. Even if she thinks it''s totally wrong. She''ll just crank it out and be like, "See, it doesn''t work." Just zero ego. It''s super insane, but it makes her super effective. They also just learn. Realistic folks tend to put too much curious into learning new tools really quickly and that makes them really flexible for whatever thing, so the same designer, we were working on Apple news, on our Apple news stuff, and there was a really tight deadline, we were moving really quickly to get it set up, and Apple news is all written, the markup is JSON, which was a person who had never written before in her entire life, had never seen it before, and in the space of, I don''t know, 4-6 weeks, she learned to build this stuff in JSON.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd was contributing at a very high level into this project. You know what I mean? There aren''t a lot of people out there that I feel that confident could do that, and that''s insane. That kind of stuff just blows my mind.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nManagers, I feel like the ones that have impostor syndrome are the ones that are probably the best.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI always get really nervous when someone''s concealing what they''re doing because I think even with the ... I can go back to the role stuff in it. I previewed it for the design team, and I was like, "Hey, I''m going to write this Doc," and I told them, "Look, it''s not going to be perfect. There''s going to be a lot of stuff wrong with it. I need you to tell me if it''s breaking or something''s not working. You have to tell me because otherwise I''ll never know and I''ll just think everything''s fine, but some of these are probably not fine, so you should tell me." I have impostor syndrome about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI know that the thing I wrote is not the best thing it could possibly be. I''m sure it''s going to screw us over at some point in some way that I haven''t yet imagined, so the people that are nervous about things going wrong, I think, are looking when things do go wrong.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI see.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nDoes that make sense? I know people who things are going wrong for sometimes and they just don''t have any idea. They''re not even watching and they''re not nervous about it, and so I feel like when you''re ... Design''s the same. I remember I would come with design work, even as a more senior person, I''d come with design work and I''d be like, "Look, this whole part of the flow, something''s wrong with it. I don''t know what it is, but something feels wrong. Something''s not okay here and I need help." I could have walked in and like, "This is awesome. This is the shit." That wouldn''t have gotten me the best feedback, and I wouldn''t have helped me find the things that were wrong. I think the folks that are just a little bit nervous about what''s going on with it, that''s a good thing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI like that. Impostor syndrome is a sensitivity training.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, totally. I think people wish they didn''t have it, but I actually really trust people that do.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nI love that. I don''t think I''ve ever heard anybody say that. It''s really cool to hear. You talked a little bit about this already, but let''s dive right into it. What do you actually do at BuzzFeed? We talked about it''s your first job managing managers. Talk a little bit about your role and why they hired you and what you''re doing there and what you''re going to be doing there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy official title is VP of Design. I report into the technology group, and my role is pretty nebulous or has been pretty nebulous, which I think has been good for me. I''ve been able to do things I don''t think I would normally be able to do. Right now, I''m responsible for all the product design. I manage three managers there, and I still manage because of some staffing problems a couple designers on the team, which will be over soon for them. I''m not sure they''re all [grate about it 00:21:19]. I started a brand design team when I got to BuzzFeed because it didn''t exist, and I started to get requests for ... I got the one on email teams, 80 people or something were like, "Does anybody have the logo? Where''s the logo?"\r\n<br><br>\r\nNo one knew where it was or who had it. I was like, "This is nuts." At bare minimum, we should have a team that has a repository of this stuff, so I started a brand design team, which is now 3 people from 0 a year and a half ago, and they handle a ton of internal stuff, like swag and logos, internal and external, and a bunch of other things, and then, also, in the last 9 months, I now run IT globally, so the folks that set up the offices and respond to help desk requests and stuff like that. All those folks are reporting into me now, which what could go wrong? They hired me because the VP of product at BuzzFeed was also the very first designer 10 years ago.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nAnd that''s great. He was also running design at the same time, and I think he realized BuzzFeed scaled to a point where he wasn''t able to do both effectively, and he really was leaning more into product, I think, and so he and I were talking and he was telling me about the design team and the challenges the face and the problems they had. He was like, "I just don''t have the bandwidth anymore to try to do something about this," so I was brought in to work on that problem. When I started at BuzzFeed, someone told me that every year your job would completely change and I didn''t know what that meant and now I totally know.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nA year and a half ago, I was running as a senior project design only. Now I have project design, brand design, IT, and even now, I''m going through this transition where ... The brand design team is in a pretty healthy place. It fees pretty good. There''s a lot of work coming in unsolicited. We''re doing bigger projects, feels pretty good. I''ve realized, at this point, that I''ve taken them as far as I can in terms of what kind of products they want to do and the support they need, and the products that we''re most involved with and the people that have been most supportive of the brand design team''s self initiative, self-initiated work, has been marketing, and the VP of marketing is a super great guy and he''s built a really strong team, has a designer on it that works with us that works really good, and we''re talking to them so much, all the time, and so I''m going through the transition right now. I actually just sent the email last week to make it official, official with HR and stuff, but we''re moving the brand design team under this VP of marketing.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWhich feels bittersweet because I started the team, but also I''m really excited for them because it''s a really great change. It''ll actually, I think, empower them even more than they''ve been. It''ll be good. At the same time, like I said, I''m managing a couple designers still right now, but the product design managers are getting into a place where a few of them are really in sync and they''re starting to really lead the team as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt used to be because, again, I came in, it was unilaterally just doing stuff, but everybody looked to me for that guidance. You know what I mean? To guide the team, to get feedback, to think holistically about everything we''re working on, and that''s not scalable for me to be that point of failure. That''s crazy, so these three people together know everything because they''re working on everything and them starting to lead the team and think more about a product design team and not just their slice of it is happening now, and that feels really good, and I''m starting to back away a little bit to give them more space to do that. You know what I mean?\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf I kept sitting there and overwriting them and speaking over them or whatever like that, that''s, again, not a good thing for them long term, and so we just rolled out this design process stuff to the entire team, and the three of them are the ones that worked on it. I guided it a little bit and obviously gave feedback just like the design roles thing, but they led that. They did it. They rolled it out. I sat in the back of the room and actually got to just cut up and make jokes with the designers, which is nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nJust heckle and throw eggs and stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt was a fun change for me. Then, like I said, by the end of this quarter, in the next couple months, I will be in a place where organizationally, where I can roll off of managing designers directly and have a designer take on the whole thing, so I''m in this weird moment where I don''t really know what''s next for me internally, and it''s something I''m talking about with my manager. I''ve been talking to her a lot about it the last couple weeks.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nStay turned. I''m sure my job will be completely different next time I see you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you fear that at all? Do you think there''s one day you''re going to be like, "There''s nothing left for me to do."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t fear that. I did say when I first got to BuzzFeed, I told someone, my boss, her name''s Dao Nguyen, and she runs all of technology. She''s very literal. She''s a very literal person, and I said to her something like, "You know, my goal here is to get everything into a place where I could just go to the movies all day and no one would know." It was silence, and she goes, "You know you can''t do that, right?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "Yes, I know. I''m just kidding." I don''t know. I''m not worried about it. She actually said something to me when I first brought it up a couple weeks ago. She said, "You''re really great at making yourself not indispensable. You''re really good at planting yourself obsolete."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nShe was saying that, it''s like a compliment. It''s a thing managers try to do sometimes where they think expanding their per view is the only way. It''s like how designers think they need to become managers. Managers think that becoming a better manager or it means accruing more power and direct influence over things, and my opinion is that if I''m setting up the teams to be successful in the long term, it doesn''t matter if it includes me or not. I want them to be the most successful and most healthy. It''s not my team. It''s BuzzFeed''s team. I want them to be in the best position to help the company for the long term, and that may or not mean that I ... I''m not running brand design anymore. It may mean that I talk to them still and want to connect those things, and eventually it may mean that I don''t talk to them at all, but product design managers talk to them more than I do. I don''t worry too much about it as long as I feel like I''m doing the best thing and the right thing for the people that I''m responsible for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so awesome. It''s very opposite than the traditional track of management, just making yourself as important as possible and making yourself as involved as possible. You''re taking the opposite approach.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI like this idea that there ... I think IT has opened my eyes up a little bit. That was a need, so as the director of IT left the company and they didn''t have anybody and they were in a similar spot to design. They were a little disorganized and didn''t have good processes and roles, Docs, and stuff like that, so my boss was like, "You know who''s really good at that stuff? It''s Cap." She pinged me one night and she''s like, "How do you feel about IT?" So I''ve taken that on, and I''ve been doing almost exactly the same things that I did with product, almost to the letter, the exact same things as I did with design to shore it up and give people confidence and make them feel good, and it''s opened my eyes to the fact there are other problems. I love those problems. I love them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt doesn''t have to be even design related. I''m excited to figure out what other stuff I''m able to do. If I held on to design forever ... I actually have had this existential crisis about it. That''s why I''m probably talking about it so much right now, where I''m like, "Do I want to be more design or do I want to be more management?" Do you know what I mean? What do I want to be? I think at an architect level, I feel like people say, "Oh, Cap. He''s a great design manager, but I don''t feel like-" ... I don''t think that''s right. I think it''s just management, in general, is something that I really feel strongly about and something I really think about a lot outside of the design stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nInteresting.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure what''s next, but I don''t really fear it too much.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s great. One of the things that you do a lot is you write a lot. Your blog is a great resource for people that are interested in this kind of stuff, but also it seems like whenever you come across a design challenge, you write a document or write a manifesto or something like that, and you had mentioned a couple times on your site, you''ve got a creative writing background really, a degree in it, so how important is writing to your process and to how you use it with your teams?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s vital. I think like measuring, people don''t put enough time into writing. I even say this for designers. It''s funny. I feel like a lot of design problems come down to just really strong copy. If the button, it doesn''t matter if it''s on the left or the right, as long as it says exactly what it does, which is probably my focus, I''ll probably be okay, and I feel like strong, crisp, clear communication is so, so, so important, and that can be the email you send to your team all the way down to documents, like the roles Doc, which is actually if you think about it, if we just shotgun to that and didn''t really pay attention to the language, it wouldn''t be effective. It probably wouldn''t be clear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think there''s a huge focus for us with everything we do. Are we providing more clarity? Are we giving people what they need to know that they''re doing a good job? Again, comes all down to writing it because we could say it. We could verbalize it, but that''s not going to take hold as much as if you have something you''re referring back to constantly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you use that? Do you refer to your own blog posts a lot or do you-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRefer to these documents a lot?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe refer to the documents all the time. We have a few different Docs. We have that product design roles Doc. We have a tech leadership principle''s Doc, which evolved out of the product design roles of product design leadership Doc that we had and we''re using, so we refer back to the tech leadership principles a lot. Each designer has documented goals against different areas in the product design roles stuff that we refer to pretty frequently with them. I do not refer to my blog ever. I feel like that''s the person I don''t want to be so bad.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nBack in 2006, I recall that I said-\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI trademark it myself. Terrible.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nLast topic before we close up. You also write a lot about and you talk a lot about recruiting. One of the really interesting things that you wrote about was about how you lie to new hires, just about whenever they start on day one, you say to them, "Here''s the way it is," and that''s not actually accurate, but it''s the way that you want it to be, so you''re setting the table for that. Can you talk a little bit about recruiting? Some of the listeners of this podcast, I think there are two really big problem areas here within this topic. One is it''s really hard to hire good people, but also, if you''re the one trying to be hired, it''s really hard to get a good job or interview. Both sides of that coin are really difficult, so what kind of advice do you have for people that are either hiring others or looking to be hired by others?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI think hiring great people, I think people think it''s hard. I don''t find it as hard as maybe other people think it is. It''s funny. There are so many designers out there. There are so many. It''s just that people only look in specific places I think and in geographic locations. I don''t know. I do not find that difficult. I think there''s a couple things that helped a lot, and we started this at Etsy where the design managers owned the recruiting process. We determined what it was. We did it ourselves. We didn''t use recruiting for leads or anything. It was up to us to figure out how to find people because what was happening was recruiting would send us, I saw this at BuzzFeed, too, they''d send us all these resumes and stuff, and they were just hoarding them.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey weren''t in the ballpark of what we were looking for, and there''s no way it''s not the recruiter''s fault. It''s a sniff test for, as a designer, I''m like, "Well, I looked at the source on their website." It''s these weird things that people won''t think to do. We got to own that process and own who was getting into the pipeline, which felt really good and also made us responsible for who''s in the pipeline. That taught us a lot. That taught me a lot. I realized pretty quickly that people didn''t really know about product design at Etsy and didn''t know how cool it was and what we were doing, and so that''s why I started not just writing about it a lot, but I started really pursuing giving talks about it.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think in the first year I was bringing at Etsy, I''m getting a ton of talks, all over the place, and all of a sudden, it started when I would reach out to people, I started to have people go, "Oh, yeah. I saw that blog post. Oh, yeah. I saw you at that conference or whatever. Etsy sounds really cool." It''s weird. You have to have a PR campaign for your own team and talk about what you believe. Again, that''s why we publish those Docs online. People then, they know what we believe, they know that we care. We spend all this time on this documentation. We super care about it and about growth and about people feeling supported and stuff, and so that''s actually been really helpful. I think as much PR as you can do for the way you want to work, you''ll find people who want to work that way.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you''re trying to get hired, I can only give advice from the position of me as a person who has tried to get hired before. I was trying to meet a lot ... My goal starting in this industry was just to meet a lot of people, as many people as possible, and not just meet them. Some people you meet, you talk to them for a few minutes and never talk to them again, but it was convenient because I just moved to Oakland and I was living by myself until 2007 or whatever and didn''t know anybody and so I needed friends, too, on top of meeting new people, so I made a bunch of friends. That''s been really valuable to me over time, especially early on.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI got fired from my very first startup job and immediately reached out to a few people and someone was like, "Oh, I have this school contract gig." I basically survived in this industry because I met and befriended people doing what I did, and that was pretty rad. I don''t know. Cold email people. I get cold emailed a lot, and that''s okay. I don''t think I''ve ever hired anybody out of that. I don''t think anybody''s ever looked for a job that way so far. I don''t know. A lot of what we do at BuzzFeed and at Etsy in terms of hiring people is very proactive. We don''t post job listings for design, so no one would even know we''re hiring, and so we reach out super ... It''s all up to us to find folks and reach out to them, so make yourself easy to find.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhy don''t you post job postings?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nWe did for a while at Etsy. I think we realized that the signal to noise ratio was so bad. Do you know what I mean? Because you have to spend the time and look through all the resumes. You know what I mean? A lot of time. In the time that it took to find one or two people out of that pile to even reach out to, you''re talking about hundreds and hundreds of resumes, in that same amount of time, I could find and reach out to maybe 10, 15, 20 people that were legitimately talented and capable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nIt''s like just doing the math about what''s the most effective for us. I don''t know if that''s right or wrong, but I also feel bad if we posted it and I just never looked at any resumes in there. I feel worse than doing my thing and wasting talent.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It puts the illness on you to be looking for people and pre-iterating a list of all the types of people that you want to be working with.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nThere''s this interesting thing that I''ve noticed with it, and I think you''d probably get this from getting resumes, too, but I think for a lot of people, we talk about diversity in tech a lot and that being a problem. I think a lot of people, design managers or whatever because they''re not involved in who is getting in the pipeline. They can push that responsibility onto recruiting. They can be like, "Oh, well, we''re having problems with diversity. We''re working with our recruiting team to recruit the right people." You''re like, "Well, you could take responsibility though." This means if it''s up to me and Sabrina and John and Tom as design managers to find the people, it is also on us if we realize we have a team that''s not diverse. Do you know what I mean? I will directly take responsibility for that problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think that''s really important. It makes us a lot more conscientious. It makes us interview a lot more people before we make a decision. I don''t know. It''s not something I think we''re super conscious of all the time, but it''s definitely there in the background. There''s a background process ring where you''re like, "Oh, who do we want on this team? What kind of experience would help us push ourselves harder or whatever?" I think that''s probably a good thing in the end.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Cap, last question for you. You mentioned you don''t mind getting cold email, so what are your favorite things for people to email you about or tweet at you about or DM you or whatever? What kind of messages do you love getting?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t if I''d say everything to get email about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nKind of an oxymoron.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t know. Every once in a while I''ll get an email about how a blog post has really helped somebody or re-framed how someone find out about something, and that feels so good. It''s funny. I don''t write for other people. I write for me. I think people think if I''m writing this stuff, I have the answer, but I am literally figuring out the answer while I write it. It''s my thought process that I''m going through, and I share that stuff again for all the same reasons I mentioned before, but it''s really cool when the problem I had and the way I figure it out, my articulation of how to solve that problem in my pseudo-solutions to it at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf that helps people, that feels really good and rewarding, so that feels really nice, but I don''t know. I get random emails from people. They''re like, "I''m coming to New York for a weekend or something. Do you want to get a coffee or whatever?" I wind up doing that. It''s cool to me how their designers are like ... I''ve met designers that are all over the career pathway where they''re just starting out. I met someone the other day who''s transitioning into design from a completely different industry and that was really cool. All the way to obviously senior folks and stuff, but that''s been really cool to get those emails, too, and to hang out with people I wouldn''t normally meet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome. We''re can people get in touch with you to do that, to ask you about coffee or tell you about a blog post that helped them out?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nMy website has my email address on it so it''s just capwatkins.com. Super complicated. All my information is out there.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Cap, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Cap </dt><dd>\r\nSure. Thanks for having me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nMy pleasure. Take it easy.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

(2926, 278, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHey Richard.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nHi.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou guys just did an amazing thing today, you open sourced your apprenticeship, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe did, we took the leap and we done the thing that we should have done a long time ago, and that''s made it public.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat is so awesome, can you just talk about everything you can about that. What does that mean? Why did you decide to do it? What is the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil? All of that stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure. The apprenticeship is a full-time paid role, where the individual that is selected through this fairly sophisticated selection process, joins our team and works on both challenges and client work during a 15 week period, and then ultimately graduates from that apprenticeship here, either becoming a full-time member of the Fresh Tilled Soil team or going on to jobs in other places. It is not an internship, it is designed specifically to teach user experience, designs skills, as it relates to what we do which is product design. We''ve done it for about four years, we started out fairly general and doing really just challenges and then a tiny, tiny little bit of client work. The more value we got out of it, the more we invested into it. We now have a full time ownership around it, so we have a director of the apprenticeship program, and that person makes sure that the right things go into the program and that the right mentors get connected with the people that are in the program, in the cohort.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking it public is our attempt to make it even better, because we''ve been doing it internally and drawing from the experiences that we''ve gained through this empirical knowledge and the events that happen here. What we try to do now is share it with the rest of the world in anticipation that others will come back to us and say, "Hey, we''ve got better ideas." Or, "We''ve got improved ideas." Build something that will become valuable to the entire design development community.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool, I have so many questions. How did it start? How did you start an apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe had been doing internships and we''d been thinking about how to make it better, and I had been travelling to Europe and hearing about apprenticeships over there. In general apprenticeships in Europe are fairly standard. Most companies, I think about 80% of companies that are doing some kind of craft have an apprenticeship program. In the states though it''s a fairly new idea. When I got back, I''d asked around and a friend of mine who runs a company called [Thought Part 00:02:40] had just started the apprenticeship program, and their apprenticeship program lives at apprenticeship.io. They had just started to experiment whether their first cohorts had gone through, and we though, "Wow, let''s just try it, let''s just get our feet wet and see if this thing works."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Now you had mentioned there''s a difference between an internship and an apprenticeship. You said you''d kind of got your feet wet with internship, and then you decided, "Okay, let''s go in an apprenticeship." I know that a ton of people probably don''t know what that means or what the difference is between the two, can you talk about that a little bit? What''s the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nSure, so internships are going to be different for each industry, but in the design industry an internship tends to be a very temporary role, it''s something that somebody might do over a summer period, or during a vacation, or between jobs, in preparation for what''s coming next. You might do an internship because you want to build out your resume, because you want to get experience in the working environment, let''s say you''re a student and you need to actually go into the work environment to know what that''s like, or in some cases if you''re in the more ad agency type environment, you would do that as a stepping stone into a junior position. An apprenticeship is a much more long term, permanent role, where you''re taking somebody who will ultimately either join your company full time, or will stay in a role very connected to what you''re creating.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe reason why it''s different is because apprenticeships are almost always paid, where internships are not. You are investing in that person as if they were going to stay with you for the long term. Internships tend to be, "Well, let''s have this person here for a short amount of time while they''re doing this thing." It''s almost agreed that it will be temporary. Whereas with an apprenticeship that person is putting their time and energy, and you''re putting you''re time, energy, and money into them in order to build a very long term relationship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. You had also mentioned that there is a sophisticated selection process too, so how does one become an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThe selection process starts with us announcing that the cohort is open and we probably get about, it varies but recently we''ve been getting about 200 applications per cohort. We then review the applications, we do some kind of back and forth with them, looking at their portfolios, understanding what it is that they''re trying to get out of the program. We''ll take that list and whittle it down to about 50 people. The 50 are then interviewed in person, so we do either here at the office or on the phone. Then what we''ll do is select about 20 of them, I think actually maybe about 15 were the last selection group, but about 15 or 20 of those candidates will go into what we call the boot camp phase. That boot camp is 2 weekends, splits by that week. During those 2 weekends they''re going to work on things that we challenge them with. We''re going to provide them with a product, we''re going to have them work on something, kind of like a Hackathon, if you will.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe''re going to assess them across different criteria. We''re going to look at their actual work, so if they''re designers we''re going to look at their design skills. If they''re developers we''re going to look at that. If they''re a combination we''re going to look at both. What we''re also secretly doing is we''re seeing how they interact with each other, how they develop their communication skills amongst each other, because most of these people will be strangers, so we want to know what it''s like for them to interact with those strangers. Do they do well in these new teams? Do they communicate? Do they present their self well? Are they capable of sharing ideas in constructive ways? Then receiving, sometimes, criticism on that and being able to respond without being overly emotional or taking it too personally. We''re looking for a lot of the soft skills to emerge during that phase. Then at the end of that boot camp we''ll select 4 or 5 to be part of the program, and they will then start the 15 week full time process.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe also onboard them as if they were full time employees, so we''ve got a 45 point onboarding process that they have to go through in order to become essentially full time members of the team. Then they''ll go through that, the 15 week program.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. It sounds like you''re looking for cues in that onboarding, but even before that in the boot camp style thing, you''re looking for cues that they''re going to be good. There are certain patterns that kind of hint at what a good apprentice looks like. Are those the same skills that make good employees or are they different?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nThey''re the same. We''re looking for skills that are going to match ... In general, good design, developer, UX people within our industry, but of course we''re definitely going to be biased, or at least have a lens around what the Fresh Tilled Soil experience is going to be. We''re looking ultimately at how they interact with our team members, are they very engaged, are they collaborative? Whereas we can''t necessarily say that other working environments or cultures will be the same. They may go work other places and find that the culture''s different that, but that''s something that we have no control over.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow many of the apprentices make the cut to become fully baked Fresh Tilled Soil employees, versus how many don''t?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn general at least 2 out of those 4 or 5 are offered positions. Sometimes more depending on how busy we are, we might find that we''re in a growth spurt and we need all of them. We''re actually going through that right now where we just had a cohort graduate and we''re starting to see a spike in traffic, in new business, and new leads. We''re like, "Oh, maybe we shouldn''t have let all of them go and find other jobs." We''re pretty good about keeping all of those graduates in our inner circle. They''re part of a very loose alumni group that we probably could do better at keeping together, I think we should have reunions, and I think that''s one thing we would like to do in 2016, is have more events where graduates are coming together again. Because they, in their new lives, will be able to offer value to each other outside of the Fresh Tilled Soil circle.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nIn the same way, going to college, the alumni network college in college too fits in the same way, so why couldn''t it work for apprenticeships too.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. They''ve gone on to do much better things than we could have even anticipated. One of our earlier cohorts, a guy graduated and almost immediately became president of the AIGA here in Boston. The list of the companies that they now work for reads like a who''s who, it''s amazing. They could network and find huge amount of value just in that little circle, and I think there are now 50 graduates of the last 4 years or something, so that''s a pretty strong group of people\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, that''s amazing. What kind of person doesn''t make the cut? Do you come across people that go through apprenticeship program and you''re like, "Not really the kind of people that we want to keep." Maybe talk about what patterns you see there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nIn our particular kind of business the client is normally a product professional who''s designing a digital product. We''re looking for people who works well with that kind of person and the team that that person works with. There are situations where you might have a really good designer, they produce amazingly visually good work, but they''re unable to communicate it effectively, or they''re unable to deal with personal issues as relates to feedback or criticism, or they may not work well in teams. They may be really, really good individual contributors, but they don''t work well in teams and they don''t collaborate well. Those are the things that we''ve identified in the past as being potential problems, and those people would definitely not make the grade.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you. Do you think every agency, or web design shop, or studio, do you think every one of them should have an apprenticeship or something like it, or is it right for maybe a certain type of shop?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI don''t think that generalizations like that would be appropriate, but I think that if you are interested in having a pipeline of talent, this would be of interest to you. If your company is growing, or if you anticipate having some kind of staff turnover over time, or you are in an industry where soft turnover is inevitable, which in our industry it is because people go places, then you need to thing about that. The other consideration is, we started over 10 years ago and a lot of the people we hired were young, they were just out of school, we were practically wet behind the ears, and as we''ve grown so have the people that have worked for us, and they''ve gone on to get into serious relationships, they''re married, they''ve got kids, their lives are changing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust by the nature of the fact that they''re aging, they''re also maturing out of certain roles, and possibly not even returning to work. The might go on paternity or maternity leave and then decide not to return back to those jobs. We need a pipeline of talent that can ensure that there''s always good talent that''s coming along. Just like your business development pipeline, you wouldn''t just hope that the business is going to come in, you need to be sure that it is. We''re just in that situation where hope is not a strategy for us, we really need to rely on that talent. I think if you''re growing then you''re probably in the same position, but is it right for everybody? I have no idea. I could not possibly say that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nDo you all have any regrets about starting an apprenticeship, like any disadvantages that you see, like maybe amount of investment, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nNo, I think initially we probably weren''t doing a very good job at understanding what the value was. We put it to the test, we also gave ourselves the permission to fail and test it out so that we could experiment. Initially we were spending a lot more time and effort doing things that weren''t really valuable. We were teaching hard skills like where the pixels go and what the code should look like. Although we still do that, we''re now teaching a lot more of the soft skills, the strategic skills, communication skills, presentation skills. Those things that are in the long run going to benefit you regardless of what the technology is. Even if you''re not necessarily coding or designing as you mature through your career, you''re still about to carry those skills with you. That''s been one big change.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other was quickly moving apprentices into client work, where initially we were bringing that in as almost like an afterthought. Now we bring them in as soon as we can and that does two things, one is it advances their skills a lot quicker because you''re in the crucible, you''re with the client, you''re dealing with day-to-day stuff, and there''s no escaping the learning there. The second thing it does is it makes them profitable. Because we''re paying them, we also are interested in what the return of our investment might be, and if they''re working on client project then they''re billable, and if they''re billable then the return is enormous. Our program is actually very profitable, it''s certainly a major contributor to our overall revenue but as it stands, it could be its own business, it would be its own educational business center, it would be profitable.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s amazing. Do clients have any problem with that? Have you had a client say something about that, or are you transparent about that with the clients? How do you deal with that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nWe''re 100% transparent about it, and because we''re transitioning them into projects where there''s already a team on it, the client is not seeing substitutions. We''re not saying, "Hey, I know you''ve been working with this person who''s senior and skilled, and we''re replacing them with this person that is junior and unskilled." We''re saying, "We''re going to augment the team with these other folks that are going to amplify the work that they''re doing." Here is the cost associated with that scope, but because we''re amplifying the work we''re also going to see higher value, and as you know we are trying our hardest to deliver value and not just price things based on the amount of time, or what the particular deliverable might be. If the client sees value in something then they have no problem in paying for it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re speaking my language. As a CEO do you interact with apprentices, do you have a CEO apprentice, what''s your day-to-day look like when interacting with apprentices at Fresh Tilled Soil?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''ve some interactions with them, my interactions are mostly around when they join the company and getting to know them, making sure that they understand the vision and the values of the company. We take that very, very seriously. We want them to understand why we exist, what the purpose is of the company, and knowing what the value is of the work that they do and understanding how it fits into the bigger picture of our vision and values helps them provide coherence and coordination with the work that they''re doing. Then, I''m also going to be involved in certain ... I would call them fire side chats, where I would sit with them and talk to them about their career, what they plan on doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is something we call design your career, where we take the design principles that they use to create successful experiences or products, and we turn them back on themselves. We essentially mirror that and say, "Okay now you''re the product, what are you going to do to design your career?" This is amazing because as somebody who teaches, and I teach at various places around the Boston community, it''s amazing how few people take a conscious part in their career path. They generally react, so they''ll decide what they want to do, they''ll go and study it, and then from then on it''s just a series of reactions. They either got offered a job, or they get fired from a job, or they lose a position because of some kind of lay-off, and they just bounce around in this vacuum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat we want to teach our apprentices is that they actually have some kind of ownership over that outcome. If they are going to design that outcome there''s a very good chance that it''ll happen. There generally are tears at some point during this process because it''s very emotional, but once you''ve got through that stage it''s so exciting because you see them, "Wow, I don''t have to go to job boards to find a job. I don''t have to just throw my resume out there with the hope of getting a job which never really works. I''m definitely going to be much more active about this. These are the companies I want to work for. This is how I''m going to go an reach out to them. I''m going to design my plan for that." It just empowers them and I think we''re giving them a skill that they''ll probably use maybe for the next 40, 50, 60 years, depending on how long they work for.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOh man, I''m getting all choked up here, that sounds so cool. We talked a lot about the apprenticeship at Fresh Tilled Soil, but not really about Fresh Tilled Soil, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that? What is Fresh Tilled Soil? What do you do there? What kind of work do you all do?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI think I said at the beginning that we''re designers of product experiences and those generally range apps and applications, websites, all the way through to designing the experience itself in the real world. We might work with a retail client and figure out what all of the touch points are in their world, mostly around the digital, but we''re working with their other partners and vendors to try and figure out how to deliver the best possible experiences. Our clients, like I said, are product professionals, but we don''t really care so much about which industries we''re working with. We mostly care about what kind of solution they''re trying to solve, or problem they''re trying to solve. We love clients who come to us and say, "We have a problem. This is what we imagine the solution to be but we''re not 100% sure." Then we would work with them through that initial problem solving stage, all through the strategy, eventually to the physical design of things. When I say physical I mean digital, as physical as that can be. All the touch points that go along with that. Clients range from as big as Intel, [NG 00:19:39] all the way through to start-ups that have recently got their funding and are just trying to figure out who they are in the world.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice, and you''re in the Boston area right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, we''re about maybe 15 minutes out of the center of town. We''re just on the Charles River, we have this beautiful old mill building that was renovated a couple of years ago, so a beautiful space.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHow much of the clients, and the approach, and the location is something that you think draws apprentices in? Or do you think it''s just like a, "Oh, this looks like a job or a thing that I can grow in, it doesn''t matter what it is, I''m going to apply for it." Or do you think the culture and the values play a big part in that?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI''m not sure the physical location matters that much. Oh my goodness, we''ve had people from Seattle, Chicago, D. C, New York. Our last cohort had 2 New Yorkers. I don''t think location matters as much. I think people, because that''s a paid apprenticeship, they''re willing to make the effort of coming here and moving here. I''d say that culture is really important. I think that we have a very balanced, inclusive culture. We try very, very, very, very hard to make the culture as safe and protective so that you can be the best person you can possibly be. Our goal is to create an environment where if you want to be creative, you feel you can be creative without any restrictions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat''s hard, it''s really, really hard. I might even be making it sound easy, but it''s incredibly difficult to do that because there are so many reasons not to feel safe in the world, whether they be the fundamental stuff like racial, or sexual, or gender related stuff, all the way through to the less fundamental stuff but it''s also self-actualizing and are you capable, do you have the confidence to do these things? Just trying to create an environment where people feel that they can do all the things that they want to do, and then stick around to do that. That''s really hard. I think people are attracted to the idea that we''re pursuing that, and hopefully one day we''ll even be successful at actually doing that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAmazing. Well Richard, last question for you before I close up, if somebody was to walk up to you at a conference, or tweet at you, or send you an email, what kind of email, or what kind of tweet are you most likely to reply to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nI love conversation that''s challenging, and I love these topics that we''ve been talking about. The improvement of our industry at every single level, whether it''s value pricing, or the education stuff that we''ve just been mentioning, whether it''s culture, I want to talk about those things because I think that that''s the fabric that our industry needs to grow from. We do a lot of talking about pixels, and strategies, and code, but I think we should really be talking about people and how they are empowered. Those are the kind of tweets and emails that I''m going to respond to.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. Where can somebody email you, or tweet at you, or find you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nOn Twitter I''m RMBanfield, or freshtilledsoil, so there''s two Twitter handles that you can reach me at. Email is Richard@freshtilledsoil.com. On Instagram I''m afrotrash.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nRichard, thank you for sharing all this amazing, amazing stuff.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nYou''re welcome, thanks very much for interviewing me.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAll right, talk to you soon.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Richard </dt><dd>\r\nChow.\r\n</dd>\r\n'),

(2942, 279, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nHi Courtney.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nHey Dan.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou''ve had a really interesting start to your career, which is that somebody gave you a chance and you started through a really intense apprenticeship. Can you talk a little bit about that, and tell us about what that looked like, and what that experience was like for you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, definitely. I''m happy to do that. For me, a definitely interesting approach. I was asked a lot when you''re first starting out in any career in your early 20s, your first question is always where did you go to school. Where did you go to college? Tell us about that, and I didn''t. My response to that normally was, "Didn''t go to a university. I interned." That always is an interesting conversation starter. Back in, I believe, I graduated high school early 2008, and was looking for opportunities in specifically web design and development. I knew that graphic design was a great discipline and something that I was interested in, but not a career choice for me. As I was looking at schools, you had the more traditional just university or community college design courses, which were okay. Then, you had art school, neither of which were a good fit for an active. One of my favorite memories from that search was I saved money for my first Mac computer, my first laptop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nKnowing this is what people in the industry use, I need to start learning the tools before I am graduated and need a job. Bought the bottom of the barrel with the student discount, a Mac book. The school that I was interested in, they were like, "You''re going to need to run Windows for this course."\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI was like, "No thanks." That was, for me, the tip off. I had a friend at the time, actually more of an acquaintance, I met at the coffee shop that I worked at. He and his business partner had, it was called Eyegate media. They did not just web design and development, those two guys particularly had a focus in video, motion graphics, and production. They both could code HTML, CSS, basic WordPress development. They were in their late 20s. I think they were starting to get a little busier and wanted ... They had the space for it, and they wanted to apprentice or intern younger ... I think everyone that applied was probably about college age. There was no one who was 14 or 35. It was a pretty informal application process. I think it was a two pager. What are you interested in? What disciplines? What do you hope to get out of this? What kind of time can you commit to it? From there, they chose me to intern with them for six months.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s awesome. Can you talk a little bit about the selection process? Why did they choose you above anybody else? It sounds like you didn''t have a portfolio at the time, or anything like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nNo.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWhat was the criteria?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThe criteria, there really wasn''t. There were very few people that they had even approached about it. I think from them, it wasn''t something that they put a Tweet up and they got 15 people that they knew, some they knew and some they didn''t know, that expressed interest. They approached, I think, 5 people.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nIt was small, small pool. You''re right. I had very little experience. I had nothing at all that was formal. I could show them these are some projects I''ve done on my own. Very little tinkering with actual HTML and CSS, so we''re talking I had Photoshop.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI had a couple books.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYou had a Macbook.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, and I had a Macbook. I was ready to be a pro.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, yeah. I was interested in the fact, it was six months. It was a 30 hour a week job at a coffee shop. I couldn''t just commit all of my time to it. It was also just, logistically I lived in the suburbs at the time. This was in downtown Dallas. The time commitment that they required from me to be present in the office was minimal enough that I could work it into my schedule, but it was just one day a week from 9-5 or 10-6. They were very flexible with that. They also had spare desks in the office. If I got off work early afternoon, I could drive to Dallas, and go set up shop, and just work around them, and learn from them on the days that I could make it work. That was really something that for, a college age student or person who just has a job and can''t completely take off ... I did not mention this was not a paid internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nSorry. Did you say that it was not paid?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. The internship was not paid.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nGot you, so you basically were doing this on your volition. Whatever you could do, you would do, and using the coffee shop job to make up the rest. Is that right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nExactly. For me, I was looking at it like I had been saving for classes and for college. Now, I have this money if I needed take a couple of shifts off because I wanted to spend more time up at the studio, and maybe assist them with a shoot, or spend some time studying. I had the flexibility to do that. For me, it was looking at it like I''m not being paid, but they''re investing time and resources into me. I''m not paying for college classes right now.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Nice. What kind of stuff were you learning when you were starting out? It sounds like you didn''t have a lot of experience. What were some of the things that they were teaching you, or some of the stuff that you were learning on your own?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nI think one of the first books we pulled off the shelf would have been "Bulletproof Web Design" by Dan Cedarholm.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I remember back then how you would do rounded corners before you could do it in CSS.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Yeah. Initially, there was a basic library of design books. There were branding books and development. It has been a while, as I recall, the first few weeks going up there ... I think it was every Thursday I would go up there. They would have some sort of project. At first, this was not engaging any real clients. These were hypothetical projects, hypothetical challenges or tasks. Maybe it was creating a one pager for myself. In tandem with having these challenges, of course, I don''t have a lot of tools to work with yet because I had no experience. I would be assigned, if you''re reading "Bulletproof Design," get through the first three chapters and then let''s see how this would apply to building this one pager for yourself.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was always applied learning. I would never say the whole day would just be spent studying. There was always some sort of application. At some point, we pulled up I think at the time, it was not Sublime Text, it was TextWrangler. You''re writing actual code. You''re working in Photoshop, and getting feedback too. That was always the biggest thing is learning how to not just turn a computer screen around and be like, "Hey. Here''s my design. What do you think? It''s cool, right?" Learning how to walk someone through here''s the design, what do you think about it? Here''s why I took this approach, and then learning how to receive feedback, and respond to that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nAwesome.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, so very baby steps. Because they were also production and we had access to video equipment, when I first started, it was I''d say 70% dedicated to web, but it''s college age. You''re trying to figure out what you want to do. I was open to photography or video. We would maybe assist them on a shoot or something like that, and be around and present in a professional environment, but maybe not in those situations actively involved yet.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, got you. These guys who were training you, who ran the studio, what qualifications did they have? Were they teachers? How did they know how to train people like you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nActually, both of them did teach part-time.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nOkay.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. There''s a small school south of Dallas that they both attended. It''s not a state school. It''s a smaller private school. I''m getting somewhere with this. Their student body is a mix. There''s a lot of international students. There are people ranging from college age kids all the way to people in their 40s and 50s. When they would teach a design class or something to do with tech, they would get just this mix bag of all sorts of students with varying levels of conversational English. I think that diversity ... Then, they had some people that were interested, and invested, and were there showing up and engaged, and some who weren''t. It was interesting to see how, I think when we interned, they weren''t teaching as much. Later on, when I worked with them for a while, just to see how that experience did make them better at teaching and engaging the inexperienced, shall we say.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. What happens next in the story? You''re working at a coffee shop. You''re going to the studio one day a week, or a little bit more whenever you can. What happens next? How do you get to the next level of learning and of being a designer?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. Towards the end of the six months, I knew I really liked what I was doing. It was hard. We all want to be good at what we''re doing. When you''re learning, you''re not good for a while. Towards the end of that internship, we had a big project. It was a pro bono site for a nonprofit. The studio, they specifically took this project for the interns for us to be involved from day one with the site map, and the strategy, content strategy, design, client, presentation. We engaged the client one-on-one in the development, and of course, choosing what CMS we should work with. Of course, we weren''t just totally let loose. There was definitely guidance and very strong suggestions on how things should be done.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat was the first time ... Again, weren''t paid, we were not paid for our time on this. We were engaging real clients, and having to take good feedback and hard feedback. We had timelines. There was real pressure. That really sealed the deal for me, because as much as I love design and I love the Internet and the medium, I''m not just going to do that for myself all day. Actually engaging people, building something that someone can use, and is purposeful is to me a very meaningful thing. We got to the end of that internship. I think maybe towards the end as well, they would have smaller projects that were from paid clients. We would estimate our hours and charge our hourly rate, and we would be compensated. Any time that we spent on a paid client project, we would get paid for, so MailChimp template, email templates, little landing pages, probably business cards.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of that, again, it was intense, but I would not say it was incredible formal. One of the guys was my friend. It was just like, "Okay, cool." There was a bit of a debrief after the six months. It was like, "You did a great job. Do you feel like you learned a lot?" A conversation, but it took a couple months. In that time frame, I had actually gotten a job. I did use one of the guys at that studio as a reference. I had a part-time job as an in-house graphic designer for a nonprofit, which was incredibly helpful to go from spending 20-30 hours a week making coffee, and then trying to switch gears and remember what I learned about HTML and CSS the day before and apply it, to working with those tools constantly and iterating.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, at the end of that, they offered ... Eyegate Media, that studio that I interned with, they had a lot of associates and contractors that they would work with on a project by project basis. Just because I was interested enough and said, "Yeah," every time they were like, "Well, would you want to work on this project? How much would you charge? How would you want to be involved?" I actually ended up working for a good two or three years, eventually being full-time working with Eyegate Media, and continuing that process in, obviously, a strictly professional, working professional environment after the internship.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Prior to starting this internship, you''re working at a coffee shop. You have some interest in graphic design. You got a computer because you feel like that''s the thing that everybody does. You got a hold of Photoshop or whatever. Then, six months later after working on these projects, and being trained doing theoretical all the way to really practical work, you''ve got enough experience or at least a portfolio enough to go get a job at a nonprofit. Then, you start freelancing with Eyegate and eventually turn full-time there. Is that accurate, the trajectory there?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s exactly what happened. It sounds weird to hear someone else say it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThat''s so cool. Fast forward to now, what are you doing now?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nPretty much the same thing. The past four years after Eyegate, almost immediately started a small web design studio with my sister. We do website design, development. We work with clients, small and medium size businesses directly now, which is cool. Really, I haven''t changed what I''ve done for about six years. Hopefully, I''m a little better at it now. Yeah, so really my day-to-day in a lot of ways, except for the business owner part and QuickBooks, a lot of the day-to-day looks very much the same. I''m doing what I like. It''s fun.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nVery cool. How much of what you do now do you think was influenced by that first six months at Eyegate Media?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nOne thing we didn''t talk about is we were involved, or at least I was out of pure interest, not everyone was ... I was involved pretty much day one with ... I wanted to understand the books. I wanted to understand invoicing, proposals, scheduling, project management. Post-internship, I actually did a lot of bookkeeping there and writing of contracts with the business owners.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nWow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nEven simple things, like we used Harvest 6 years ago, longer than that, 6-7 years ago. Having those tools and knowing this is a pretty good workflow, like this is where we have our proposal, this is where we have our estimates and time tracking, this is how we handle the books and invoicing, was immensely helpful. Now, there are just so many tools and resources. Even when I started Telegraph four years ago, having that experience was crucial with Eyegate media. Even setting up an LLC, just seeing what things work and what things don''t work when you have a lot of partners, our format is very similar. We''re a two person company, but we work with contractors frequently, and just learning some techniques on how to structure those relationships. I have no idea how I would land where I am today without that experience. Certainly, the college that told me that told me I needed a PC to get through their design course would not have brought me to this point. I can say that with confidence.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nNice. Now, do you have interns? If you don''t, one day do you think you will?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nDefinitely. I don''t right now. It was funny. The other day I realized I''m about the age that those guys were when they interned me. I know there are a lot of freelancers and small digital studio owners who work from home, and I have off and on for a while. One of my main motivations this year to get a space and put some time, effort, and resources into making it a space that''s inviting, and roomy, and functional was I wanted to be able to have an intern in the next year or so. Someone that can learn from me in a way that I learned from my mentors, or people that gave me a path forward when I really didn''t see any other options.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah, it''s pretty clear from your story what value an internship had for you. It certainly helped you grow into what you''re doing today for a studio owner. Somebody like yourself now, who runs your own studio, what would be the value for hiring an intern? Certainly, there''s cheap labor in there too, but there''s got to be something more than that, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. I don''t want to get too sentimental, but paying that whole concept forward because it made such an impact on my personal and professional life, and really changed the trajectory. Some internships aren''t going to be as ... That was a very high value experience. I can''t promise that that''s the experience every intern, or any intern I ever have, will walk away with. The hope is if someone''s interested and ready to dedicate some time, I think that as rewarding as it will be hopefully for someone, I think it would be very rewarding for me to be able to do that with somebody, and on the giving end instead of the receiving end if that makes sense.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. That''s so cool. Thanks so much for sharing your story, Courtney. As we round out, I have one last question for you. How can people get in touch with you?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nYeah. You can get a hold of me casually on Twitter, Courtney271 is my Twitter handle. If you want to contact me directly, you can email me at courtneyb@wearetelegraph.com. My company site is wearetelegraph.com if you want to take a look.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt><dd>\r\nThanks Courtney. Have a good rest of the day.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Courtney </dt><dd>\r\nThanks. You too, Dan.\r\n</dd>'),

(2958, 280, 'transcript', '<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Aarron, what does VP of Design Education at InVision actually mean?</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>It means, I and my team, we''re trying to help product designers do better work. We''re doing that by identifying common problems that we see in companies and design teams. We visit companies, we talk to people, in person and on the phone, a lot. We''re doing interviews with experts in the field, and we''re trying to find out where teams break, how design teams scale, as a company grows. I think that''s a really important topic, because we''re seeing our industry mature, and seen a lot of pain points around that issue. We''re also trying to find out what are the best practices of product design. We''re not trying to be exhaustive, like every positive thing that someone could potentially do, but like, "What are the common patterns of design-driven companies, teams that are healthy, doing good work, interacting with the company in a positive way, where design in the company has a seat at the table, leadership and strategy?" We want to identify those best practices, and we want to go deep on those. We want to study them very carefully.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe''re writing about them, and that''s going to turn into some advice that we''re going to share with everybody. Not just InVision customers, but with everyone in the product design world: People that are just getting started and want to try to learn more about what product design''s about and how to do that well, veterans that have been doing this for years. We want to try to help everyone. We want to try to elevate design in the software industry.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Interesting. I know a lot of the stuff that InVision does. I mean, there''s a clear bias for what that is, because InVision has a product that designers use. Obviously, that research kind of informs that stuff, but it also seems like InVision does a lot of things that maybe don''t directly influence the product, but just, sort of are interested in helping the industry at large. Is that accurate, and if so, where does that come from?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Absolutely, yeah. It''s worth noting that I''ve been in InVision for just a couple months now at time of recording here, and I''ve been a customer for years, when I was leading the UX team at MailChimp, and then leading an R & D team, and a new products team. I know InVision as an outsider, as a consumer of the product, and I saw how it changed the way that we work, so I have that perspective. Now I''m an insider, and I look at how there are a lot of different companies using the platform to bring people together, and bringing designers together, but it''s also, we''re seeing really interesting things, like big companies that ... They''ve got the whole legal team in there, or they''ve got like engineering inside of InVision. What''s interesting to me about that is, design is becoming more relevant, it''s becoming ... We can see in our industry, just as a broad cultural phenomenon, that design is a competitive advantage for a lot of companies, important competitive advantage, and consumers are becoming more sophisticated, they know what a good experience is, and what a really bad experience is. They may not necessarily be designers or design nerds, but they know what''s good and what''s bad. I watch how product companies are using InVision and how that''s connecting these design teams to lots of other teams, and helping just facilitate conversations, collaboration. Capital One, for example, I just visited them a couple weeks ago, and they''re doing a lot of interesting stuff there. They''ve got a strong initiative, from CEO down, that design is an important part of their strategy and what they want to do. Their legal team is inside of InVision looking at everything they''re doing. They''re having these really positive conversations back and forth. If you''ve been in the design world for a while and you''ve interacted with a lawyer once or twice ... It doesn''t always go so well, right?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Right. Right.</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>You work really hard on an idea, and then a lawyer will come in and say, like, "Sorry, you can''t do that," for some obscure legal reason. "I need to protect us from any liabilities." That''s not what''s happening at Capital One. Clearly, as a financial institution, they''ve got to have legal oversight, but it''s a dialogue, and it''s early, and it''s often, and that''s the key things: That design becomes less of a black box. That more people can see it, it''s transparent, more people are involved in the conversation.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s so cool. As far as I know, from InVision, before you got there, I don''t think that VP of Design Education was a thing, right? Is that a new position for you? Did you come up with that? How did that come about?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, it''s a new position. It''s Clark Valberg, who''s the CEO, co-founder, who came up with the position. You may or may not know this about me, but I spent the first half of my career, first chunk of my career, as a professor. I taught design, I taught coding, I taught all kinds of this stuff, art. In the second chunk, I was a product designer at MailChimp. This role, as a VP of Design Education at InVision just squishes those two things together. Understanding product design and teaching a broad audience about that, in lots of different ways, but Clark ... That was Clark''s vision, and it''s one that was not hard to convince me, because these are two things I''m really passionate about.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, can you talk a little bit about your experience as a teacher? I mean, I know you spent a lot of time working with Opera, and working with the web standards groups about how to teach that kind of stuff, and you had put together curriculums and published books, and all sorts of stuff, so ... Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you found as important and valuable to teaching up-and-coming designers, engineers, product people, things like that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, so I taught at a few different universities in the United States, and I taught a little bit abroad in Berlin. As I mentioned, a lot of different subjects, [such as 00:06:53] history of communication media, non-linear narrative, and like, front-end developments, etc. I also was heavily involved and led a team, it was part of the Web Standards Project to create an open curriculum to try to help universities catch up. It''s really hard for universities to keep up with the pace of the technology industry that ... We are moving fast, and we''re not ... Historically, we haven''t done a great job of helping educational institutions keep up with us. Now, there''s a lot of different business models, that are trying to hack that. You''ve got Codeacademy, and you''ve got Udemy, and Treehouse, and all these different, Skillshare, etc., that are out there that are helping people supplement their learning. Especially people that have a liberal arts education already, like they''ve got a bachelor''s and they just need to supplement that, but ...\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy experience, how to teach well, especially in this industry, for me, it was always really important to be a practitioner, as well as an educator. There was a very close, cyclical connection to that work, that I would do a thing for a client, I would make things, and I would try out new things. Then I would bring that into the classroom, and I''d have a real-world example to show. I would challenge my students to try out these new things, and that, would cause me to revisit or find flaws. Because basically I''ve got like twenty-five or thirty people doing that thing using that technique .... Finding problems with that, struggling to figure that out, and in the process of teaching that technique, you actually master it, way better than if you were just doing it professionally.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDoing something on your own is pretty self-explanatory, because it''s all this internal dialogue, but when it''s an external dialogue and you''re teaching twenty or thirty people who aren''t clear about it, that is when you get true mastery of the subject; and so for me, that was always a really important thing. When I left teaching, I filled that gap by speaking at conferences and writing. I feel like that''s one of the key things for ... Whether you''re new to the industry or you''re a veteran, is writing, even if you''re not a good writer. Writing is critical thinking. It is exploring your ideas. It is validating or invalidating. It''s clarifying a process for yourself, and getting in that habit of, you do a thing, you learn a thing, and now you''ve got to share it. When you have to share it, that''s when you''ve truly learned it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>That''s awesome. Let''s go back to the "practitioner plus educator" thing. That''s certainly a model that, you know, you''re not the first one to recommend that, or that there''s a lot of common wisdom that the teachers and educators as practitioners, helps kind of beef up that. Is there a parallel for students? Like, should students be ... Is there some equivalent, like learners plus practitioners, or like is there a parallel there that they can do to be better than just people that are absorbing things all the time?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, I think there is a parallel, because, I reflect back on the students that, you know, hundreds of students I''ve taught over the years. The ones that tended to be the most successful, the most curious, after they graduate they tended to build the career they really wanted, they were actually doing some work in school. Which means they were working harder, right? Because, school is already a busy, that''s a lot to take on, and then to go home at night, and then you''re working on client work, or you''re trying to juggle that in the middle of the day or something like that. It''s not easy, but students that do that, they understand the content a lot better. They ask questions more, because they''ve got something at stake, "I''m trying to figure this out. This is real," and they''ll hang out after class and say, like, "Okay, I''m working with this client, how do I do this?" and they, I just felt like they got a better education, because they were, they had skin in the game.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThey were already trying to serve themselves, it''s not just like, "Okay, teacher, bring all of the ideas and concepts to me, and I''ll try to soak them up." They''re actively shaping their education on their own.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>You had this unfair advantage, where you''ve been educator, like, formally educator, and then you''ve been a director, I mean, you helped to start the UX practice at MailChimp. How similar is it to be a teacher, to be an educator, in a higher ed setting, and to be a director, or run a product, or help mentor designers that are on your team? Are they the same thing, are there differences? Maybe you could talk a little bit about that.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think there are some similarities. There''s a lot of armchair psychologist involved in both of those roles.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Like, students that are struggling with personal issues who are, just not doing their best work because of something that''s going on in their life. [I 00:12:18] spend a lot of time chatting with people about those sorts of things, and it happens when you''re leading a team, as well; and so, you have to get good at sniffing out problems, talking to people one-on-one on a regular basis. That''s a really important part of being a manager, is meeting with people one-on-one. Not just about syncing up on, "Did you do the 5 things on your to-do list?" but like, "How''s life? What''s going on? What''s happening at home?" Because all of those factors, they help you build a rapport so people trust you, but they also help you identify like, "Okay, this person''s under a lot of stress right now, and that''s probably why they missed that deadline," or, "Their work''s not as good as it could be. They''re just not as focused on their work right now."\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think that''s similar, and then I also found myself ... When I was hiring, I would often focus on soft skills, and if someone was a bit short on the concrete skills that I needed them to jump in the job and be a researcher, be a really great UI designer, oftentimes, I knew I could just coach that up. I could help them with those skills, but if they have really good soft skills, if they''re collaborative, they''re humble, they''re open-minded, they have fire in their belly, they''re going to ... They''re a good self-starter and learn on their own. They have those things, I''m very interested, because I can pretty much point you in the right direction. As long as you''re interested in the subject, I can take you further, and that''s all about teaching.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Any advice that you can give to somebody who would, say, in your position at their own company, so somebody that is a director, or somebody that is a manager, maybe, a design manager somewhere, and they have a team of people working, working for them, working with them, what are some things that they should be looking out for, and the best ways to, kind of, educate their team?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Are you asking specifically about, "How do I help this team grow?"\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, exactly.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah. I think that, in the design world, the most important part of helping a team grow, helping people grow individually, helping careers blossom, you got to get in the habit of feedback. You''ve got to build a culture of feedback, and you do that in a few ways. I find that the space, a design studio''s space, says a lot about whether or not feedback is happening.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Like the physical environment?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Physical environment, yeah ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Oh, wow.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... shapes our behavior. If you walk into a design school ... I''ll give you an example, I visited the d.School, Stanford d.School, a couple years ago, gave a guest lecture there, and the place is totally fascinating to me, because it''s so messy ... There''s just stuff everywhere, stuff on the walls, post-it notes, there''s work on tables, furniture pushed here, pushed there, and I loved that, because it''s, they are artifacts of ideas and conversations that are happening. Now, I''ve been to a lot of different companies, in the Valley, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, you name it, and they often are ... Have these beautiful murals, they''re, like, the interior design is incredible, it''s super high-end. They''ve got the best hardware, they''ve got these $3,000 standing desks. You look around, there''s nothing on the walls that wasn''t intended to be there, and the way it''s designed, it''s not flexible for ideas, for collaboration and conversation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt''s an environment where, for solo work, which is ironic. Because what we actually need is the teams to work together: The design teams, but also, the design team also has to face with developers, QA, project managers, marketing, so many different teams. Shaping the space, getting the work out of the, these aluminum containers, MacBooks, onto the wall, drawing on them, having conversations, having daily stand-ups to sync on projects ... Having regular design reviews, where there''s critical discourse that''s guided by a moderator, you know, a critique that is well-considered, instead of just, like, "Okay, what do you think about this?" "I like this red." "I like that shape," like, that''s not productive. There''s a way to do a critique well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThen, when you start to see your team going back and forth ad hoc, giving each other feedback, that''s a strong signal you''ve got a healthy culture, and that''s a place where people can grow. I''ve talked to a lot of different designers over the years, and I''ve mentored designers as, you know, now that I''m not a teacher, and they often ... I say, "What do you want?" "I just want to be in a place where I can grow," and when those designers visit, they go on site for an interview, they know if that''s a place where they can grow or not, because it looks pristine or it''s messy. Like, they see the conversations happening; so feedback''s important to help your team grow mentally, help careers grow. It''s also going to help you recruit. Because when people come in, they''re going to sense it, they''re going to feel it, and they''re going to want to be part of that environment.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>So cool. Last question, as we round out. The other side of that, let''s say someone listening is a product designer or a UI designer on a team where they don''t have somebody dedicated. They don''t have a VP of Design Education there. They don''t have somebody dedicated to figuring out how they grow, or where things break, or what patterns exist. What can they do to be proactive about making sure that they''re learning, and that their growth path and their trajectory is actually developing in a good way?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I think that we all have to just stay curious, and it''s very easy in a job to kind of settle into a routine. Things we can do to break routine are often, are good to do. I think it''s also really important to get away from your desk and go talk to people. Make time to get to know colleagues, make time to go have lunch, make those recurring. You don''t have to have an agenda, you''re not trying to talk about work, necessarily. You''re just getting to know people, because making great work, it''s not a solitary thing, for most of us. It''s a lot about people skills, so honing people skills is critical, and for many who neglect to develop that, to cultivate those skills, they''re going to get deselected. They''re going to get let go from their team, because if you can''t work with other people, you can''t actually do good work, ultimately. You''ve got to figure out how to work with other people, so I think those things are important.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Aarron, thank you so much. This has been great, like, so many nuggets of wisdom there. I guess the last thing before we close out is, how can people get in touch with you, where can they do that, and on top of that, what are some things that they should get in touch with you about? Like, what are your favorite things to respond to?\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>I love to talk to people about the creative process, about building teams, about struggles that they have with design teams. I''m fascinated about how Agile is sweeping our industry ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... that it creates a big problem for a lot of designers. We''re trying to figure out how to adapt to that scenario, so a lot of topics that I like to chat about. You can find me on twitter, on @aarron. It''s with two As and two Rs because my dad misspelled my name at the hospital, but it made it easy to get my first name as my twitter handle, so it''s just aarron ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Nice.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>... and my website is <a href=" aarronwalter.com">aarronwalter.com</a>, so ...\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Dan </dt>\r\n<dd>Awesome. Thanks so much, Aarron. I appreciate it.\r\n</dd>\r\n\r\n<dt>Aarron </dt>\r\n<dd>Yeah, thank you!\r\n</dd>'),
